  description:
    value: >-
      <p>While you have an animated melee weapon, you can use your reaction when
      a creature makes a weapon attack against you to attempt to block it,
      rolling a d8 and adding the number rolled to your AC for that attack. You
      make this choice after the creature makes its roll, but before the GM says
      whether the attack hits or misses. If you attempt to block a melee weapon
      attack in this way and the attack misses, you can immediately make one
      weapon attack against the attacker as part of the same reaction.</p>

      <p>When you use this ability, if you take the Attack action on your next
      turn, you can only make one weapon attack as part of that action. This
      attack canâ€™t be made with the animated weapon you used to attempt to block
      the attack.</p>

    value: >-
      <p>As a bonus action, you can produce an instant reaction that provides
      potent magical healing. A creature can use its action to consume this
      draught or administer it to another creature within 5 feet of it before
      the start of your next turn, causing the target to regain 1d8 hit points.
      If you have the Practiced Quaff feature, you can consume a Healing Draught
      as part of the bonus action used to make it.</p>

      <p>A creature can benefit from a number of these draughts up to its
      Constitution modifier (minimum of 1), after which they provide no benefit
      to that creature until it finishes a long rest. A Healing Draught that
      isnâ€™t consumed before the start of your next turn loses its potency.</p>

      <p>The number of hit points the draught restores increases by 1d8 when you
      reach 5th level (2d8), 11th level (3d8), and 17th level (4d8).</p>

  description:
    value: "<p>You can use your mind to create a burst of elemental power, blasting a target you can see within range. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes [[/r 1d10]] cold damage.</p>\n<p>For each die of cold damage dealt, the creature’s speed is reduced by 5 feet until the end of their next turn.\_When a creature is hit by an attack of your Elemental Blast or fails a saving throw against this power, it becomes frozen until the end of its next turn, giving it disadvantage on its next attack roll or Dexterity saving throw, and reducing its speed by an additional 5 feet (to a total of 10 feet).</p>\n<p>If the attack roll is a critical hit or the target fails their saving throw by 5 or more, the target becomes restrained while frozen.</p>\n<p>You can spend psi points up to your per use limit to add the following modifiers to (you can add multiple modifiers). The points must be spent when choosing the target of the power.</p>\n<p><strong>Amplified (1+ psi points):</strong> The target takes an extra 1d8 cold, fire, force or lightning damage on a hit for each additional point spent.</p>\n<p><strong>Lasting (1 psi point):</strong> Your Elemental Blast leaves a 5-foot-radius sphere of devastation behind where it strikes until the start of your next turn. Creatures that enter this zone for the first time or end their turn in it must make a Constitution saving throw or suffer the secondary effects (slow, burn, arc) of the blast as if they had been hit by it.</p>\n<p><strong>Massive (1–3 psi points):</strong> You unleash a massive blast; rather than making an attack roll, all creatures within a 15-foot cone must make a Dexterity Saving throw. On failure, they take the effect as if hit by the Elemental Blast. The size of the cone is doubled for each point up to 3 spent (2 points for 30 feet, 3 points for 60 feet).</p>\n<p><strong>Overcharged (0 psi points):</strong> You take 1d4 force damage and do not add your proficiency bonus from the attack or spell save DC for your Elemental Blast, but increase the damage it deals by twice your proficiency bonus.</p>"

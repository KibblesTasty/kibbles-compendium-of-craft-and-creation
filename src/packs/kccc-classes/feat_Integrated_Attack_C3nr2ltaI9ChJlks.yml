      <p><em>(Prerequisite: Integrated Armor or Warplate; incompatible with Iron
      Grip)</em></p>

      <p>You integrate a melee weapon into your Warsmith’s Armor. When you apply
      this upgrade you must have a weapon to integrate, and you must choose
      where on your armor the weapon is located. The weapon can’t have the heavy
      property. You are proficient with this weapon. As a bonus action you can
      activate the weapon.</p>

      <p>You must treat it as though you are wielding it with one hand, but you
      can’t be disarmed of it. Once activated, you can use this weapon when you
      take the attack action, and it doesn’t require the use of a hand or your
      Warplate Gauntlet. You can apply this upgrade multiple times, selecting a
      new weapon and new location on your armor to install it.</p>

      <p>When you activate your integrated weapon, you can immediately make one
      attack with it. While it is active, if you take the attack action on your
      turn, you can make an one additional weapon attack with your integrated
      weapon using your bonus action.</p>

      <p>Your power of conviction allows you to believe what you choose to. If
      you spend at least one minute convincing yourself of something—no matter
      how absurd—spells and effects to determine if you are telling the truth
      will register that you believe what you have convinced yourself of.</p>

      <p>Additionally, your psionic powers allow you to impose your will upon
      reality to a certain extent. When you expend 1 psi point, you can perform
      a minor alteration to reality:</p>

      <ul>

      <li>You can conjure any Tiny object you can imagine that is worth 1 sp or
      less. This creates an object as you envision it, but doesn’t grant you
      knowledge you do not otherwise have (for example, you would be unable to
      conjure a key to a lock unless you had a perfect mental image of the
      correct key).</li>

      <li>As an action, you can change the color or taste of a Small or smaller
      object with 10 feet. This change lasts for 1 minute.</li>

      <li>As a reaction to a creature within 30 feet taking damage (including
      yourself), you can change the damage type they take.</li>

      </ul>

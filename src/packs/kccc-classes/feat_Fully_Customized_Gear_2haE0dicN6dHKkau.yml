      <p>Starting at 14th level, you’ve mastered the customization of your
      Warsmith’s armor. You can add one additional Upgrade to your armor that
      doesn’t count against your Upgrade total.</p>

      <p>Additionally, during a long rest, you can now swap out any one upgrade
      for any other upgrade of the same level, so long as you don’t have an
      Upgrade that requires the Upgrade you are removing as a prerequisite, or
      an incompatible Upgrade.</p>

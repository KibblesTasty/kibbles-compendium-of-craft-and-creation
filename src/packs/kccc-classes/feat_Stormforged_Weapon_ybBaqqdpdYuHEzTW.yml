  description:
    value: "<p>Starting at 1st level, you harness the elemental power of thundering storms to create a powerful weapon. This weapon requires attunement, only you can attune to it, you are proficient with it while attuned, and you can only be attuned to one Stormforged Weapon at a time. If you have multiple Stormforged Weapons, you can change which one you are attuned to during a long rest.</p><p>If you lose your Stormforged Weapon or wish to create additional ones, you can do so over the course of three days (8 hours each day) by expending 200 gp worth of metal and other raw materials. When you make a new Stormforged Weapon, you can make the same or a different type, and select the same or different upgrades.</p><p>Select one of the following and consult the Stormforged Weapon table for its statistics.</p><p>\_</p><h2>Thunder Cannon</h2><p>You use the power of thunder to launch a projectile with terrible power, if limited accuracy, over long distances. Ringing out with a booming crash, it brings fear to the battlefield.</p><p>@Compendium[kibbles-compendium-of-craft-and-creation.kccc-classes.G0NmNY8Mb3avA94U]{Stormforged Weapon: Thunder Cannon}</p><p>\_</p><h2>Hand Cannon</h2><p>Forgoing the guiding barrel, this pack uses the thundering power to launch a projectile with all the force of a Cannon, though its effective range is far more limited.</p><p>@Compendium[kibbles-compendium-of-craft-and-creation.kccc-classes.pJufTQrfmH6WWJxb]{Stormforged Weapon: Hand Cannon}</p><p>\_</p><h2>Kinetic Hammer</h2><p>Rather than launching a projectile with the thundering force, you keep that force imbued in the weapon, allowing for devastating force to be applied to the attack.</p><p>@Compendium[kibbles-compendium-of-craft-and-creation.kccc-classes.iMBg9JqQZsyM8wPc]{Stormforged Weapon: Kinetic Hammer}</p><p>\_</p><h2>Charged Blade</h2><p>You create a bladed weapon that channels the harnessed power of the elemental storm power directly into the blade, causing it to lay waste to all it strikes. This weapon deals lightning damage instead of thunder when applying Thundermonger.</p><p>@Compendium[kibbles-compendium-of-craft-and-creation.kccc-classes.K1SvHQYaBIJyxNYn]{Stormforged Weapon: Charged Blade}</p><p>\_</p><h2>Lightning Pike</h2><p>You create a charged blade and stick it to the end of a pole, making it slightly more unwieldy, but giving it devastating reach. This weapon deals lightning damage instead of thunder when applying Thundermonger.</p><p>@Compendium[kibbles-compendium-of-craft-and-creation.kccc-classes.QW5vSRqgq6QFXrCC]{Stormforged Weapon: Lighting Pike}</p><p>\_</p>"

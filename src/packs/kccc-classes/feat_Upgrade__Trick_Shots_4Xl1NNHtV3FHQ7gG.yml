    value: >-
      <p>At the end of a short or long rest, you can add one of the following
      effects to a piece of ammunition or a thrown weapon, turning it into a
      trick shot; the effect is expended when you use the trick shot:</p>

      <ul>

      <li><strong>Arcane Trick</strong>. You can imbue a cantrip or 1st-level
      spell you know into the shot, casting it on impact where the shot lands.
      The target of the attack is also the spell’s target.</li>

      <li><strong>Bouncing.</strong> You can attack a target within range that
      has total cover from you if you know the target’s location, bouncing the
      shot off a surface. The target has the benefit of half cover for the
      attack, instead of total cover.</li>

      <li><strong>Ricochet.</strong> If you hit a target with the shot, you can
      make another attack roll against a different target within 10 feet of the
      first as part of the same attack.</li>

      <li><strong>Smoke Shot.</strong> You can use the shot to deploy a Smoke
      Bomb on impact where the shot lands.</li>

      <li><strong>Special Tip.</strong> The shot deals one of the following
      damage types of your choice: bludgeoning, piercing, slashing, acid, cold,
      fire, or lightning.</li>

      </ul>

      <p>You can select this upgrade multiple times, allowing you to make
      multiple trick shots per rest. You can have a maximum number of trick
      shots equal to the number of times you have selected this upgrade.</p>

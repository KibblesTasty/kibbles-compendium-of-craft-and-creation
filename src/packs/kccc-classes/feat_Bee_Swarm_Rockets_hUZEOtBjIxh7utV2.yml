    value: >-
      <p>You design a type of tiny, firecracker-like device, which can release
      rockets in large numbers. You have a maximum number of rockets equal to
      your inventor level. As an action, you can release between 1 and 10
      rockets. Each rocket targets a point you can see within 40 feet of you.
      Each creature within 10 feet of one of these points must make a Dexterity
      saving throw against your spell save DC.</p>

      <p>Creatures in the area of effect of multiple rockets make a separate
      saving throw for each rocket. For each failed save, a creature takes 2d6 +
      1 fire damage, or half as much damage on a successful one.</p>

      <p>You can replenish your supply of rockets to your maximum over the
      course of a long rest.</p>

      <p>Your Warsuit gains an integrated grappling hook set into your gauntlet.
      As an attack or as an action, you may target a surface, object or creature
      within 20 feet. If the target is Small or smaller, you can make a Strength
      (Athletics) grappling check to pull it to you and grapple it.
      Alternatively, if the target is Medium or larger, you can choose to be
      pulled to it (this doesnâ€™t grapple it). Opportunity attacks provoked by
      this movement are made with disadvantage.</p>

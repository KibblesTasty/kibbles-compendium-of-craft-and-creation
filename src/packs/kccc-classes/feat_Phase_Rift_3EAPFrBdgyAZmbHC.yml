    value: >-
      <p>You step through space, traveling up to 10 feet in a straight line
      leaving a spatial tear behind. You can pass through creatures but can’t
      pass through objects, buildings or terrain more than 4 inches thick. Any
      creature in the path of this tear must make a Dexterity saving throw or
      take [[/r 1d8]] force damage.</p>

      <p>You can spend psi points up to your per use limit to add the following
      modifiers to Phase Rift (you can add multiple modifiers). The points must
      be spent when choosing the target of the power.</p>

      <p><strong>Blurring (1–3 psi point):</strong> You gain an illusory
      duplicate, as per the mirror image spell. You gain 1 duplicate per psi
      point spent (up to a maximum of 3). One remaining image fades at the start
      of each of your turns.</p>

      <p><strong>Disruptive (1+ psi points):</strong> Each target that fails
      their saving throw takes an extra 1d8 force damage for each point
      spent.</p>

      <p><strong>Echoing (2 psi points): </strong>You immediately use Phase Rift
      again with the same action.</p>

      <p><strong>Ethereal (2 psi points):</strong> You can pass through solid
      objects, buildings, and terrain as long as you end your Phase Rift in a
      space you can occupy. If your Phase Rift would end inside a space you
      can’t occupy, the power fails.</p>

      <p><strong>Long (1–3 psi points): </strong>You can travel an additional 10
      feet for each point spent.</p>

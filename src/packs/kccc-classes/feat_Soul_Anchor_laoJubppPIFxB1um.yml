    value: >-
      <p>You bend all of your knowledge of soul devouring artifacts to create
      the pinnacle of dark magic. You bind your soul to an item. When you die,
      your body and equipment crumble to ash, reforming after 1 hour within 5
      feet of the item to which you bound your soul. Once you revive in this
      way, you canâ€™t revive in this way again for 1d10 days. After the first
      time you have revived, your creature type becomes undead (if it was not
      already). The item ceases to work if you have not slain a creature in the
      last 10 days. The item has 25 hit points and an AC of 10. When you bind
      your soul to it, the item gains immunity to all damage types beside one,
      to which it gains vulnerability. You select this damage type when you
      create it.</p>

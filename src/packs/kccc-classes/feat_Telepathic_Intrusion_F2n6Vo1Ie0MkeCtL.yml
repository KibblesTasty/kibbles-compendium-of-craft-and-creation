    value: >-
      <p>You assault the mind of a creature you can see directly. The target
      must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw, or take 1d8 psychic damage. If the
      target fails the saving throw, it has disadvantage on attacks made against
      you until the start of your next turn. You can choose to deal no damage to
      the creature when it fails its saving throw.</p>

      <p>You can spend Psi Points up to your per use limit to add the following
      modifiers to Telepathic Intrusion (you can add multiple modifiers). The
      points must be spent when choosing the target of the power.</p>

      <p><strong>Meddling (2 psi points):</strong> You make one creature
      invisible to the target creature or cause the creature to see something
      that is not there with the effect of minor illusion until the start of
      your next turn if it fails its saving throw.</p>

      <p><strong>Overwhelming (3 psi points):</strong> The target is stunned
      until the end of its next turn if it fails its saving throw.</p>

      <p><strong>Rending (1+ psi points):</strong> The target takes 1d8 psychic
      damage for each additional point spent on a failed save.</p>

      <p><strong>Terrifying (1 psi point):</strong> The target is frightened of
      you until the end of your next turn if it fails its saving throw.</p>

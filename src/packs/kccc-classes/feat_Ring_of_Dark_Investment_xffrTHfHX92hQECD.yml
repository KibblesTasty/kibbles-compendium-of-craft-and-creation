    value: >-
      <p>You create a ring that can store a fragment of corrupted power. As an
      action, you can infuse an Inventor spell you know (including spells gained
      from upgrades) with a casting time of 1 action into the ring. You cast the
      spell as normal (expending the spell slot if it is 1st level or higher)
      but the spell doesnâ€™t take effect, and is stored in the ring for later
      use. When you take the Attack action while a spell is stored in your ring,
      you may replace one attack with the stored spell. You may also release the
      stored spell directly, casting it at its normal casting time. A stored
      spell fades if you remove the ring, or if it is unused at the end of a
      long rest.</p>

      <p><strong>Curse:</strong> When you store a spell in your ring, your
      current and maximum hit points are reduced by 1 + the level of the spell
      (1 for a cantrip).</p>

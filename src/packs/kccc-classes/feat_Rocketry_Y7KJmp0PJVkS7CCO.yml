      <p>Combining your understanding of explosives with advances in delivery
      and stabilization, you produce the logical extreme: powering a
      rocket-based payload with your devastating knowledge.</p>

      <p>You can choose any instant reaction you know as the payload for your
      rocket. Rockets must be prepared ahead of time, and you can prepare a
      number of them up to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of 1) at the end
      of a short or long rest. When you finish a rest, any unused rockets lose
      their potency and must be remade due to their volatile components.</p>

      <p>A rocket targets a point you can see within 500 feet of you, but the DC
      of the instant reactionâ€™s saving throw is reduced by 2 for every 100 feet
      it travels. When the rocket reaches its desti-</p>

      <p>nation, the instant reaction takes effect, centered on that point.</p>

      <p>Alternatively, you can load an alternate payload into your rockets,
      which can be an object that weighs no more than 1 pound, replacing the
      effect of the instant reaction. This alternate payload can be salvaged
      during a rest.</p>

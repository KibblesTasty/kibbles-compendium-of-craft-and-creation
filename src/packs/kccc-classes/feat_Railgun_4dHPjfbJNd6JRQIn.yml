    value: >-
      <p>The range of your Thunder Cannon is doubled, and creatures can no
      longer gain cover from objects that are less than 2 feet thick. You
      Thunder Cannon attacks now pierce the target, and can attack a second
      target within range behind the first target, though Thundermonger damage
      can still only be applied once.</p>

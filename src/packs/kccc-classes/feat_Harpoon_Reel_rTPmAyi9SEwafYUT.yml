  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You devise an alternate attack method for your Stormforged Weapon that
      launches a harpoon attached to a tightly coiled cord. This attack has a
      normal range of 30 feet and a maximum range of 60 feet, and it deals 1d6
      piercing damage. This attack doesn’t apply Thundermonger damage. This
      attack can target a surface, object, or creature.</p>

      <p>A creature struck by this attack is impaled by the Harpoon unless it
      removes the Harpoon as an action, which causes it to take an extra 1d6
      damage. While the Harpoon is stuck in the target, you are connected to the
      target by a 60 foot cord. Dragging the connected party via the attached
      cord causes the creature moving to move at half speed unless they are a
      size category larger.</p>

      <p>While connected in this manner, you can use your bonus action to
      activate the Reel action, pulling yourself to the location if the target
      is Medium or larger. A Small or smaller creature is pulled back to you,
      ending the connection. Alternatively, you can opt to disconnect the
      cord.</p>

      <p>This attack can’t be used again until the Reel action is taken.</p>

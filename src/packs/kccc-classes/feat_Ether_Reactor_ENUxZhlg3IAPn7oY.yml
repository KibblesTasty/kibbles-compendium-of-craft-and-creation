    value: >-
      <p>You construct an ether reactor that feeds your armor, powering its
      upgrades with arcane energy. The Ether Reactor has 6 charges, and can be
      used to power upgrades that cast spells, even upgrades that would normally
      only recharge after a rest can instead be cast by using charges, spending
      1 charge per level of the spell you are casting. You can cast spells at a
      higher level by expending more charges. It regains all charges at the end
      of a long rest.</p>

      <p>If your Ether Reactor has no charges left, you can overdraw your Ether
      Reactor for one last burst of power, but your armor is temporarily
      immobilized and your speed while wearing your armor becomes zero for a
      number of rounds equal to the level of the spell cast. Once you overdraw
      it, you canâ€™t do this again until you finish a long rest.</p>

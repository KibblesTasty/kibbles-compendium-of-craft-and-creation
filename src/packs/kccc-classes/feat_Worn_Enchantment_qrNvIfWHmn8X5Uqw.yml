  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You can enchant an item you are wearing, such as a cloak or scarf, to
      animate and assist you with a task, be it climbing a wall, grappling an
      enemy, or picking a lock. You can expend a spell slot of 1st level or
      higher as an action to gain proficiency in one Strength- or
      Dexterity-based skill of your choice until you finish a long rest.
      Additionally, you can choose to use up all the magic in the item to gain
      advantage on one ability check using the chosen skill. After you do so,
      you lose the proficiency granted by this upgrade.</p>

      <p>A metal hook attached to a chain. You are proficient with this melee
      weapon, and it has the Special property. It deals 1d6 piercing damage.</p>

      <p><strong>Special:</strong> This weapon has a range of 20 feet. When you
      hit a target that is more than 5 feet away from you, if the target is
      Medium or smaller, you can make a Strength (Athletics) check contested by
      its Strength (Athletics) to pull the target toward you. On a successful
      check, a Small or smaller target is pulled to you, and a Medium target is
      pulled half the distance (rounding up) toward you. The creature takes 1
      additional damage for each 5 feet it is pulled.</p>

      <p>If the creature is Medium or larger, when you hit a target more than 5
      feet away from you you can pull yourself up to 10 feet toward the
      target.</p>

  description:
    value: "<p>At 1st level, you’ve mastered the creation of the essential reusable tools for surviving the battlefield as a gadgeteer. You have the following items:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Gadgetsmith Weapon.</strong> Choose one of the following\_from the Upgrade section: Impact Gauntlets, Lightning Baton, Repeating Hand Crossbow, Ricocheting Weapon,\_or Shock Generator. You gain the chosen upgrade, and\_it doesn’t count against your total number of upgrades.</li>\n<li><strong>Grappling Hook.</strong> You can forgo any attack you make as part of the Attack action to throw your grappling hook at a target within 20 feet of you. The target can be a creature, object, or surface. If the target is Small or smaller, make a grapple check against it, pulling it to you and grappling it on a success. If the target is Medium or larger, you can instead pull yourself to it (no check required); this doesn’t grapple the target. Opportunity attacks provoked by this movement are made with disadvantage.</li>\n<li><strong>Smoke Bomb.</strong> As an action, you can use a smoke bomb to cast the fog cloud spell centered on yourself, without expending a spell slot and requiring no components. The spell lasts for a number of rounds equal to your Intelli-gence modifier and doesn’t require your concentration. When you cast fog cloud in this way, you can choose for it to have a radius of 5, 10, 15, or 20 feet.</li>\n</ul>"

      <p>If your armor is perfect, why would you ever need to remove it? Your
      armor is considered both Integrated Armor and Warplate, and you can select
      the base AC and properties of either armor set, and select armor with
      either prerequisite as a prerequisite (though you canâ€™t select upgrades
      that are incompatible with either type). </p><p>Your creature type becomes
      construct. You are immune to disease, and you gain immunity to poison
      damage and the poisoned condition. You no longer need to eat, drink, or
      sleep, though you must remain inactive for a minimum of 4 hours during a
      long rest to allow your systems to recharge. You can absorb certain types
      of healing magic, allowing you to recover hit points from magical effects
      that do not otherwise affect constructs (such as the cure wounds
      spell).</p>

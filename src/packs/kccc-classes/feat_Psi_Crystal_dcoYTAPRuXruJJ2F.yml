      <p>You gain the ability to impart part of your mind into crystal. You can
      expend 2 psi points to cast the
      @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.JGT5bNqu9REL7Fuz]{find familiar} spell,
      but your familiar takes on the statics of a
      @UUID[Compendium.kibbles-compendium-of-craft-and-creation.kccc-monsters.Actor.h8vm2LDlq6pbJ23Z]{psi
      crystal} and the material component required is a crystal worth 10 gp
      instead of the normal material components. The Psi Crystal gains your
      Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. You can use Psionic Disciplines
      with a range greater than self through your Psi Crystal as if you were
      standing in its location. If the psi crystal is destroyed, you gain its
      memories as your own. While you have a Psi Crystal active, as a bonus
      action, you can deactivate it to regain 2 expended psi points.</p><p>When
      you summon a Psi Crystal, you can store a fragment of your personality in
      it that you can then release by shattering the crystal. Select one of the
      following when summoning a psi crystal.</p><p><em>Courage.</em> When you
      make a saving throw against the frightened condition, you can use your
      reaction to shatter the crystal, releasing that emotion to gain advantage
      on the save.</p><p><em>Cowardice.</em> When your Psi Crystal is within 30
      of you and a creature comes within 5 feet of you, you can use your
      reaction to shatter the crystal, releasing that emotion and immediately
      moving up to your speed away from the creature without taking any
      opportunity attacks.</p><p><em>Cruelty.</em> When your Psi Crystal is
      within 30 feet of a creature that takes damage, you can use your reaction
      to shatter the crystal, releasing that emotion and causing the creature to
      take additional damage equal to your psion level.</p><p><em>Sympathy.</em>
      When your Psi Crystal is within 30 feet of you and another creature, if
      that creature takes damage, you can use your reaction to shatter the
      crystal, releasing that emotion and granting the creature resistance to
      that damage. You take an equal amount of damage to the damage they
      take.</p>

      <p>You gain the ability to impart part of your mind into crystal. You can
      expend 2 psi points to cast the find familiar spell, but your familiar
      takes on the statics of a psi crystal (below) and the material component
      required is a crystal worth 10 gp instead of the normal material
      components. The Psi Crystal gains your Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma
      scores. You can use Psionic Disciplines with a range greater than self
      through your Psi Crystal as if you were standing in its location. If the
      psi crystal is destroyed, you gain its memories as your own. While you
      have a Psi Crystal active, as a bonus action, you can deactivate it to
      regain 2 expended psi points.</p>

      <p>Psi Crystal</p>

      <p>When you summon a Psi Crystal, you can store a fragment of your
      personality in it that you can then release by shattering the crystal.
      Select one of the following when summoning a psi crystal.</p>

      <p>Courage. When you make a saving throw against the frightened condition,
      you can use your reaction to shatter the crystal, releasing that emotion
      to gain advantage on the save.</p>

      <p>Cowardice. When your Psi Crystal is within 30 of you and a creature
      comes within 5 feet of you, you can use your reaction to shatter the
      crystal, releasing that emotion and immediately moving up to your speed
      away from the creature without taking any opportunity attacks.</p>

      <p>Cruelty. When your Psi Crystal is within 30 feet of a creature that
      takes damage, you can use your reaction to shatter the crystal, releasing
      that emotion and causing the creature to take additional damage equal to
      your psion level.</p>

      <p>Sympathy. When your Psi Crystal is within 30 feet of you and another
      creature, if that creature takes damage, you can use your reaction to
      shatter the crystal, releasing that emotion and granting the creature
      resistance to that damage. You take an equal amount of damage to the
      damage they take.</p>

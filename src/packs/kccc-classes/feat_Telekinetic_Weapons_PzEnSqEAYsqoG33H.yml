    value: >-
      <p>You telekinetically fling a weapon at a creature or object. Choose a
      weapon within 15 feet that isn’t being worn or carried, or choose a weapon
      under your control. Make a ranged spell attack. On hit the target takes
      damage equal to the weapon’s damage dice. The range of the attack
      decreases to 15 feet if the weapon has the heavy or special property, and
      increases to 60 feet if the weapon has the light property.</p><p>You can
      use Psionic Mastery points on this power, and this power counts as a
      Discipline Power of the Telekinetics Discipline (for example, for the
      purpose of Empowered Psionics).</p><p>You can spend psi points up to your
      per use limit to add the following modifiers to Telekinetic Weapons (you
      can add multiple modifiers). The points must be spent when choosing the
      target of the power.</p><p><strong>Multiple (1+ psi points):</strong> For
      each additional psi point spent, you can fling an additional weapon,
      making a separate attack and damage roll for each weapon
      flung</p><blockquote><p><strong>Flinging Magic
      Weapons</strong></p><p>Strictly ruled-as-written, most magic weapon
      properties wouldn’t apply to Telekinetic Weapons, but personally I would
      grant a flung +1 weapon its +1 to attack and damage rolls. However, if you
      allow this, this should not be allowed to stack with any sort of focus or
      magic item that grants bonuses to spell attack rolls. Only one bonus
      should apply to a given roll.</p><p>Keep in mind that there’s not
      inherently a way to get your weapon back, though you may be able to with
      other Psion abilities (such as Telekinetic Hands), so flinging magic
      weapons may not be an ideal tactic for longer ranges.</p></blockquote>

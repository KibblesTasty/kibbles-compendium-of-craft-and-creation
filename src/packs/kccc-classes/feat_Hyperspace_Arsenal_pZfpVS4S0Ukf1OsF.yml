    value: >-
      <p>You expand the pocket dimension to store multiple sets of Wargear, as
      well as up to 100 pounds of weapons or items. As a bonus action, you can
      conjure and equip any weapon or item stored in the pocket dimension.
      Additionally, you can swap out your attuned Wargear for another set of
      Wargear with this upgrade in the pocket dimension during this bonus
      action, as long as it also has this upgrade, instantly ending your
      attunement to the set you were wearing and attuning to the new set. Once
      you swap your Wargear using this feature, you canâ€™t do so again until you
      finish a short or long rest.</p>

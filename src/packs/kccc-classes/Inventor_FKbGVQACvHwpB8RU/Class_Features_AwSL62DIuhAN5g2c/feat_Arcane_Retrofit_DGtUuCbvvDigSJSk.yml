  description:
    value: "<p>Additionally at 2nd level, you gain the ability to retrofit magical gear. During a long rest you can perform a ritual using any +1, +2, or +3 weapon—excluding artifacts and sentient weapons—to transfer the magic into an inventor weapon (a weapon created by a subclass feature or upgrade). For example, you can turn a +1 longsword and your Impact Gauntlet into a +1 Impact Gauntlet. This includes weapon-like Upgrades that make attack and damage rolls, such as a Warsmith’s Force Blast.</p>\n<p>You can’t transfer any properties from a magical weapon besides a bonus to attack and damage rolls, and the original weapon is destroyed in the process.</p>\n<p>Additionally, you can convert a set of armor with a magical bonus to AC to a lighter armor type.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Additional Retrofits.\_</strong></p>\n<p>At the GM’s option, this feature can be expanded to do similar tasks. For example, you may be allowed to turn a +1 heavy crossbow into a +1 light crossbow, or the GM may choose to allow this feature to work with other magical armor or weapons, such as converting adamantine chain mail into an adamantine chain shirt.</p>\n</blockquote>"

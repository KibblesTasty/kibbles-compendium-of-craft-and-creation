  description:
    value: >-
      <p>At 10th level, your experience in creating your own wondrous inventions
      makes you more adept at crafting a magic item than normal spellcasters.
      Creating a non-consumable magic item takes you half the time it would
      normally take.</p>

      <p>Additionally, you can make 1 hour of progress toward crafting a magic
      item, potion, or scroll during a long rest.</p>

      <blockquote>

      <p><strong>Interaction with the Crafting System</strong></p>

      <p>If you are using the Crafting System presented later in the book, this
      reduces the time a crafting check takes to 1 hour, allowing you to make
      two crafting checks during a long rest, or eight during a work day.</p>

  description:
    value: >-
      <p>By the time you reach 5th level, your Infused Armament grows more
      powerful. If you infuse or animate a weapon, you can infuse or animate one
      additional weapon at the same time (having two Animated Weapons, two
      Infused Weapons, or one of each). If you have multiple Animated Weapons,
      you can attack the same or different targets with them during a turn.</p>

      <p>If you cast a spell of 1st level or higher using an item from Infuse
      Magic or an upgrade, or from a magic wand, you can cast the cantrip from
      your Blasting Rod as a bonus action.</p>

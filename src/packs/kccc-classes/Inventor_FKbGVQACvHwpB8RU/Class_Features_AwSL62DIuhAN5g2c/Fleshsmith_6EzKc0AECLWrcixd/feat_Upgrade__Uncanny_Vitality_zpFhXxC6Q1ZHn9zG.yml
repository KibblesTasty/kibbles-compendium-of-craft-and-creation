      <p>Starting at 3rd level, your body has such vitality that it is
      constantly able to restore itself. While you have 1 or more hit points, at
      the start of your turn, you can choose to expend a Hit Die and regain hit
      points equal to the value rolled + your Constitution modifier (as normal
      for expending a Hit Die). If you have zero hit points, you can use this
      feature at the end of your turn.</p>

      <p>Additionally, you regain Hit Dice equal to your Constitution modifier
      on a short or long rest (in addition to normal Hit Dice recovery on a long
      rest).</p>

      <p>If you are missing any limbs at the start of a long rest, at the end of
      the long rest the missing limbs are regenerated.</p>

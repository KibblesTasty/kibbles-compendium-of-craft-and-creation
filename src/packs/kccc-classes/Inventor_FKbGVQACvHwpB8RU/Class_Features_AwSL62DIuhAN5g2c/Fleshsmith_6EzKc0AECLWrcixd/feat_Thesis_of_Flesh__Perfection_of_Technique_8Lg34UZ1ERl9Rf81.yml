      <p>Others may call themselves “flesh smiths” or “flesh crafters”, but you
      are a flesh artist. Flaying, dicing, deboning, you’ve mastered it all.
      When you select this thesis option, you gain proficiency with martial
      weapons and gain the Flaying Hook upgrade, and it doesn’t count against
      your upgrade total. You can integrate your Flaying Hook into another
      weapon, attaching its heavy chain to the hilt of your weapon, allowing you
      to attack with either weapon, and being considered to be wielding both
      when wielding one. Any magical bonus to attack and damage rolls the
      attached weapon is also applied to the Flaying Hook (if higher).</p>

      <p>When you use your Flaying Hook to pull a target or pull yourself toward
      a target, you can use your bonus action to make a single weapon attack
      against it. You can do this a number of times equal to your Inventor level
      and you regain all uses at the end of a long rest.</p>

      Upgrades, an Infusionsmith’s Animated Weapon, Blasting Rod, or Infused
      Weapon, a Potionsmith’s Alchemical Reagent Pouch and Alchemical Fire or
      Alchemical Acid, or a Thundersmith’s Stormforged Weapon.</p>

      can’t apply Infused Weapon to another weapon granted by this class.</p>

      <p>Starting at 3rd level, you can take the Help action as a bonus action
      when assisting your golem.</p>

      <p>Additionally, when you take the Help action to aid an ally (including
      your golem) in attacking a creature, the target of that attack can be up
      to 30 feet away from you, rather than within 5 feet of you, if your ally
      can see or hear you.</p>

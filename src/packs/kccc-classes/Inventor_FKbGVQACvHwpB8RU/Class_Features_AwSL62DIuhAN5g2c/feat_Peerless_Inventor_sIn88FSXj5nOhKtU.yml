      <p>At 20th level, your mind is always thinking of new options and clever
      solutions. At the end of a short or long rest, you can create a temporary
      version of an Upgrade from your subclass that you meet the prerequisites
      for but donâ€™t already have. This upgrade must have a level requirement of
      11th level or lower, and it lasts until you finish a short or long rest,
      at which time you can select a temporary Upgrade with this feature
      again.</p>

    value: "<p>Starting at 14th level, when you use Soul Investiture, you can double the amount of bonus damage gained, but take 1 necrotic damage for each turn it has been active at the end of each of your turns while it is active. This damage bypasses immunity and canâ€™t be resisted in any way.</p>\n<p>\_</p>"

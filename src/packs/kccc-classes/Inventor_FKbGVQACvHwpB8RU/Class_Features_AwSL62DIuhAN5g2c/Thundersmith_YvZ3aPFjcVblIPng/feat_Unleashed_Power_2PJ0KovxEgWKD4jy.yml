    value: >-
      <p>Starting at 14th level, when rolling damage for Thundermonger or your
      Stormforged Weapon, you can expend a spell slot to reroll a number of the
      damage dice up to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of one) and maximize
      a number of dice equal to the level of the spell slot expended. (You may
      maximize the dice rerolled this way, or the dice that were not rerolled)
      You must use the new rolls.</p>

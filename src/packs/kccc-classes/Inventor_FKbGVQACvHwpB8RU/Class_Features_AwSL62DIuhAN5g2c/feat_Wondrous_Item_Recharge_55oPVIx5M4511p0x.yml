    value: >-
      <p>Starting at 10th level, you can recharge a magic item that has charges
      or per rest uses, as long as those charges or uses can only be used to
      cast spells. To restore charges or uses, you perform a ritual that takes 1
      minute and expend a spell slot of a level equal to or greater than the
      spell slot level of a spell cast by the item.</p>

      <p>The number of charges or uses restored to the item is equal to the
      number of charges or uses required to cast that spell using the item
      once.</p>

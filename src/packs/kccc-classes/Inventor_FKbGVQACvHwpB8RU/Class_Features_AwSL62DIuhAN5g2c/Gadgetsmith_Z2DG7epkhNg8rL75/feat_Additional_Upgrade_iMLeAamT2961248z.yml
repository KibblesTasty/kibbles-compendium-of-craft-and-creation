      <p>At 3rd level, you’ve mastered the essential tools and have begun to
      tinker with ways to expand your arsenal. The number of upgrades you can
      have, based on your class level, increases by one. It increases by one
      again at 5th level (for a total of two more than shown in the Inventor
      class table).</p>

      <p>Starting at 3rd level, you can disassemble your gadgets and create
      different ones during a long rest. When you finish the rest, you can
      replace any upgrade you have with a new one.</p>

      <p>The chosen upgrade must still be one that is valid for the level at
      which you gained the replaced upgrade. For example, at 9th level, you can
      only have one upgrade that has a 9th-level prerequisite.</p>

      <p>Additionally, if one of your gadgets is destroyed, you can use this
      feature to recreate it over the course of a long rest, which requires
      materials worth 20 gp.</p>

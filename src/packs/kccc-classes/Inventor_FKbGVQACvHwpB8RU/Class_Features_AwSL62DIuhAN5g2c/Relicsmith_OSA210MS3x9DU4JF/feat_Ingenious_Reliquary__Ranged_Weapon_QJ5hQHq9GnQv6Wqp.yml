  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You integrate your divine relic into a ranged weapon, giving it an
      unlimited supply of sacred power to use as ammunition. It no longer
      consumes ammunition and instead fires radiant bolts of power, dealing
      radiant damage. If the weapon has the loading property, it is removed.</p>

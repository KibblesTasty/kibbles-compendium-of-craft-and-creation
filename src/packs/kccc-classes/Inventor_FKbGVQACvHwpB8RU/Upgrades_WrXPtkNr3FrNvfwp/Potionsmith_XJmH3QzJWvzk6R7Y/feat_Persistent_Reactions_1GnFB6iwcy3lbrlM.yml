    value: >-
      <p>Your instant reactions that have an area of effect persist in that area
      until the start of your next turn. While they persist, each creature that
      enters the area for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there must
      repeat the saving throw against the effect. You can choose to make the
      effect not persist in this way when you take the action to produce the
      instant reaction.</p>

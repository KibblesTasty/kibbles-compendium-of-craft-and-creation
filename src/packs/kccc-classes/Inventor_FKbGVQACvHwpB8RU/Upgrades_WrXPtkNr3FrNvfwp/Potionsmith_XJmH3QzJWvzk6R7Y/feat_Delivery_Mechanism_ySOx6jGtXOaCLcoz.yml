  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You modify the stability of your reagents and develop a better delivery
      mechanism. You can target a point within 40 feet of you for your instant
      reactions (including ones gained from upgrades, such as Explosive
      Reaction) and infused potions that target a point. This additional
      precision enables you to better target the effects, allowing each creature
      of your choice in the area to automatically succeed on its Dexterity
      saving throw against the effects of your instant reactions and infused
      potions.</p>

      <p>Additionally, when making an attack roll with an instant reaction or
      infused potion, you can use your Intelligence modifier, instead of your
      Dexterity modifier, for the attack roll.</p>

      <p>When you create a Healing Draught, you can add a more potent concoction
      to it. A creature that consumes this potent draught can treat any dice
      rolled to determine the hit points it regains as having rolled their
      maximum value, and the creature gains the benefit of a greater restoration
      spell. Once you make create a Healing Draught in this way, you canâ€™t do so
      again until you finish a long rest.</p>

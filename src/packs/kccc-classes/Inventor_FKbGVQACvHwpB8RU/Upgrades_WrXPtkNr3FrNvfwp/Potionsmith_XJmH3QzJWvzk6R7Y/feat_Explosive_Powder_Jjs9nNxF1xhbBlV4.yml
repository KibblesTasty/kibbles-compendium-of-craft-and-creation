  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You’ve managed to stabilize and refine your Explosive Reaction. You can
      prepare a number of Explosive Reactions up to your Intelligence modifier
      (a minimum of 1). These Explosive Reactions don’t detonate instantly, but
      rather last for 1 minute and will only detonate when exposed to fire. A
      creature can be affected by the damage from no more than two Explosive
      Reactions simultaneously, but structures take the full damage of all
      Explosive Reactions in their area.</p>

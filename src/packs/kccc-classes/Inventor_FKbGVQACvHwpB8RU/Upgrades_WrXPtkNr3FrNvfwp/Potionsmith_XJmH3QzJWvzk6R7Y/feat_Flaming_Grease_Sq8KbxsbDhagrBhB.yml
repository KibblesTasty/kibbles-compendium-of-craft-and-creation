      <p>You tweak your grease formula to be flammable, as grease should be.
      When you cast grease or use it to make an infused potion, the effect
      becomes flammable. If the grease takes fire damage, all creatures in the
      spell’s area take 2d4 fire damage. The grease burns for a number of rounds
      equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum 1).</p>

      <p>Additionally, when you cast the grease spell or use it as an infused
      potion, you can instead use it to coat a weapon. This coating lasts for 1
      hour or until it takes fire damage, igniting the grease. Once ignited,
      that weapon deals an extra 1d4 fire damage on a hit for the next
      minute.</p>

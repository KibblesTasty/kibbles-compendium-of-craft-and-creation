      <p>You create a Philosopher’s Stone, allowing you to recreate wonders of
      alchemy. As long as you have a supply of non-gold metal, you can create up
      to 1 pound of gold each day (50 gp worth). Additionally, the Philosopher’s
      Stone can be used in place of a diamond worth up to 500 gp for a spell’s
      material component; it isn’t consumed when used in this way, but it
      becomes inert for 24 hours, providing no benefits.</p>

      <p>You can brew a special potion using your Philosopher’s Stone called an
      Elixir of Life. Brewing this potion takes 8 hours and requires crushing a
      diamond worth at least 2,000 gp into it. An Elixir of Life causes a
      creature that drinks it to cease aging for 4d4 years. A creature that
      drinks this elixir also gains the effect of a death ward spell, which
      lasts until it is triggered, instead of 8 hours.</p>

      <p>A more potent Elixir of Life can be created, increasing the number of
      years that the creature ceases aging by 1d4 for each additional diamond
      spent.</p>

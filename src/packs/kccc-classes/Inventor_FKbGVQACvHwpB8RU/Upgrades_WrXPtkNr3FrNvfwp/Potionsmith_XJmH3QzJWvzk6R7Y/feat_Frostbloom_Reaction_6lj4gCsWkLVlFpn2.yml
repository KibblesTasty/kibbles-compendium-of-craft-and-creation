      <p>As an action, you can produce an instant reaction, throwing a
      combination of devastating, endothermically reactive reagents at a point
      within 20 feet of you, which causes a bloom of ice to erupt. The area
      within 5 feet of that point becomes difficult terrain until the end of
      your next turn.</p>

      <p>Each creature in the area must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw
      against your spell save DC or be caught by the ice, taking 1d6 cold
      damage. If a creature that fails its saving throw is entirely in the area
      of effect, it becomes restrained until the end of its next turn. A
      restrained creature can use its action to make a Strength saving throw
      against your spell save DC, ending the effect on itself on a success.</p>

      <p>The damage increases by 1d6 when you reach 5th level (2d6), 11th level
      (3d6), and 17th level (4d6).</p>

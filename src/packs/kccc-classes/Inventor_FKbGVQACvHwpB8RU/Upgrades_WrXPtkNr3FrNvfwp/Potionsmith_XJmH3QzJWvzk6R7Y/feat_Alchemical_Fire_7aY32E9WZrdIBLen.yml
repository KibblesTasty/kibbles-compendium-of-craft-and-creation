      <p>As an action, you can produce an instant reaction, tossing a quick
      combination of reagents at a point within 20 feet of you, which causes
      searing fire to flare up in a 5-foot-radius sphere centered on that point.
      Each creature in the area must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw against
      your spell save DC or take 1d8 fire damage.</p>

      <p>This damage increases by 1d8 when you reach 5th level (2d8), 11th level
      (3d8), and 17th level (4d8).</p>

      <p>Alternatively, you can use a bonus action to prepare this instant
      reaction as a ranged weapon with which you are proficient. It lasts until
      the end of your turn, and it has the finesse and thrown (20/60)
      properties. On a hit, it deals damage equal to failing the saving throw
      against this effect. The damage dealt by this attack doesnâ€™t include your
      Strength or Dexterity modifier.</p>

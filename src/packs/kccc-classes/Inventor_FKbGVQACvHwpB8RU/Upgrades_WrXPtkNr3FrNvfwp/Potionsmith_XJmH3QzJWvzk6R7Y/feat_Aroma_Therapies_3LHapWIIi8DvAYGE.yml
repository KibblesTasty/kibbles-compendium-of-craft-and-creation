    value: >-
      <p>You expand your alchemical knowledge to be able to produce incense and
      simmering reagents that grant benefits to those that inhale their fumes. A
      creature that spends a long rest surrounded by these fumes regains an
      additional 2d4 Hit Dice, its exhaustion level is reduced by 1d4 (instead
      of 1), and it is cured of any nonmagical diseases itâ€™s suffering from.</p>

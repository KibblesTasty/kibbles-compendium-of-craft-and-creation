      <p>You gain resistance to poison damage. Additionally, at the end of a
      long rest, you can choose up to five creatures (including yourself) to
      become inoculated against poisonous effects you can produce that require a
      Constitution saving throw (such as the Poisonous Gas instant reaction or
      the cloudkill alchemical infusion). You and each of the chosen creatures
      automatically succeed on saving throws against these effects until the end
      of your next long rest.</p>

      <p>You use the secrets of alchemy to create an Infusion Stone. You can use
      this stone in the process of infusing potions in place of expending a
      spell slot level. The spell you infuse in this way must be of a level for
      which you have spell slots.</p>

      <p>Once you use the Infusion Stone, you can’t use it again until you
      finish a long rest.</p>

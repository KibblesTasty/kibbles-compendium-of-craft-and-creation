  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You concoct an infused potion that can rapidly warp a creature’s body,
      temporarily mutating it in extreme ways. You add the polymorph spell to
      your list of available spells for your Alchemical Infusions. When a
      creature consumes this infused potion, the spell has a duration of 1 hour,
      but the creature that consumed it can end the effect early as an
      action.</p>

      <p>Once a creature consumes this infused potion, it can’t be affected by
      the polymorph spell in this way again until it finishes a long rest.</p>

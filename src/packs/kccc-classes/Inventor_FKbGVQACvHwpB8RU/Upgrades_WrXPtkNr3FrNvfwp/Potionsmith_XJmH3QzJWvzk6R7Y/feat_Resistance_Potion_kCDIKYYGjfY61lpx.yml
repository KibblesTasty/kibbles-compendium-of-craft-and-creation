    value: >-
      <p>You create a formula for making a simplified temporary resistance
      potion. During a long rest, you can create a potion that grants the
      drinker resistance to acid, cold, fire, lighting, poison, or thunder
      damage (selected during the long rest) for 10 minutes when consumed. If
      not consumed, it loses potency when you finish your next long rest.</p>

      <p>You learn the alchemical process for creating a homunculus minion. You
      can cast find familiar without expending a spell slot or material
      components other than your alchemical reagents and blood. This familiar
      can appear in any Tiny shape you want, though it uses the statistics of a
      creature that can normally be chosen by the spell, and it is a construct
      or monstrosity, rather than one of the types listed in the spell.</p>

      <p>You build an improved hand crossbow. You have proficiency with this
      weapon, which has a normal range of 30 feet and a long range of 120 feet,
      and it has the ammunition and light properties, as well as the special
      property (described below). It deals 1d6 piercing damage on a hit.</p>

      <p><strong>Special.</strong> This weapon doesn’t require a free hand to
      load, as it has a built-in loading mechanism. When you make an attack with
      this weapon as part of the Attack action, and you don’t have disadvantage
      on the attack roll, you can choose to make the attack roll with
      disadvantage to make one additional attack with this weapon as a bonus
      action. The attack roll for this additional attack is also made with
      disadvantage.</p>

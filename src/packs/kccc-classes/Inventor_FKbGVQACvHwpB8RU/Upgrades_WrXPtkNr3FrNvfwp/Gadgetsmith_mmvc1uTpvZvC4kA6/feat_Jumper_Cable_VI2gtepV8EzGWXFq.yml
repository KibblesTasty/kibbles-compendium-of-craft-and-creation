    value: >-
      <p>Once per turn when you deal lightning damage with a cantrip from your
      Shock Generator, you can add your Intelligence modifier to the damage
      dealt.</p>

      <p>Additionally, you can use your Shock Generator as an action to make a
      DC 10 Intelligence (Medicine) check, attempting to stabilize a dying
      creature within your reach. If you succeed on the check, the creature
      regains 1 hit point, becoming conscious again, and gains a number of
      temporary hit points equal to your inventor level. When you stabilize a
      creature in this way, it gains one level of exhaustion.</p>

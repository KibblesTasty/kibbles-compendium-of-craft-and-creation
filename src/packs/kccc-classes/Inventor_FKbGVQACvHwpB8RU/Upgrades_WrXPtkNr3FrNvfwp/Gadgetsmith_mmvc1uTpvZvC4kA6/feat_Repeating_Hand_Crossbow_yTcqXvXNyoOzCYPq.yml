      <p>@UUID[Compendium.kibbles-compendium-of-craft-and-creation.kccc-classes.Item.snM4Q7LleBWihrHZ]{Repeating
      Hand Crossbow}</p><p>You build an improved hand crossbow. You have
      proficiency with this weapon, which has a normal range of 30 feet and a
      long range of 120 feet, and it has the ammunition and light properties, as
      well as the special property (described below). It deals 1d6 piercing
      damage on a hit.</p><p><strong>Special.</strong> This weapon doesn’t
      require a free hand to load, as it has a built-in loading mechanism. When
      you make an attack with this weapon as part of the Attack action, and you
      don’t have disadvantage on the attack roll, you can choose to make the
      attack roll with disadvantage to make one additional attack with this
      weapon as a bonus action. The attack roll for this additional attack is
      also made with disadvantage.</p>

    value: >-
      <p>You thread your nets with metal reinforcement, making them tougher and
      more conductive. The net has an AC of 15 and resistance to slashing
      damage. Whenever a creature restrained by the net takes lightning damage,
      it takes an extra 1d6 lightning damage.</p>

      <p>Only you have proficiency with your Steelweave Nets. You can have a
      number of these nets up to your Intelligence modifier at a time (a minimum
      of one), and you can replenish your supply of them over the course of a
      long rest by forging normal nets into Steelweave Nets.</p>

      of your blows. You have proficiency with this weapon, and it has the
      finesse and light properties, as well as the special property (described
      below). It deals 1d6 bludgeoning damage on a hit. You can select this
      upgrade up to two times, making a separate weapon each
      time.</p><p><em><strong>Special.</strong></em> When you make an attack
      with this weapon, you can choose to forgo adding your proficiency bonus to
      the attack roll. If your attack hits, you can add double your proficiency
      bonus to the damage roll.</p>

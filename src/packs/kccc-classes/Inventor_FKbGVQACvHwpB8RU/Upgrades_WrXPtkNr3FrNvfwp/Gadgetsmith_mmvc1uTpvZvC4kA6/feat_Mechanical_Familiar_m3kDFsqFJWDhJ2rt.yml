      <p>You create the blueprint for a small, mechanical creature. At the end
      of a long rest, you can choose to create a familiar based on it, casting
      the find familiar spell without expending a spell slot. When cast in this
      way, the familiar is a construct. It stays active until you deactivate it
      or it is destroyed. In either case, you can choose to reactivate it at the
      end of a long rest.</p>

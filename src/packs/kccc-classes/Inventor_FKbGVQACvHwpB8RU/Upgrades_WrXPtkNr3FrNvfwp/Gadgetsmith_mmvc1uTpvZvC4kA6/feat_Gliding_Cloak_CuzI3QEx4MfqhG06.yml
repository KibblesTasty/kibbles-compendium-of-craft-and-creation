  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You make a cloak that allows you to glide while falling. When you fall
      more than 10 feet and aren’t incapacitated, you can spread the cloak to
      reduce your rate of descent to 30 feet per round, taking no falling damage
      when you land. While falling in this manner under normal gravity, you can
      move up to 2 feet horizontally for every 1 foot you descend.</p>

      <p>You create a high-luminosity discharge device. As an action, you can
      use the device and target a point within 30 feet of you. Any creature
      within 20 feet of that point must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw
      against your spell save DC or be blinded until the end of its next turn.
      Once used, this gadget canâ€™t be used again until you finish a short or
      long rest.</p>

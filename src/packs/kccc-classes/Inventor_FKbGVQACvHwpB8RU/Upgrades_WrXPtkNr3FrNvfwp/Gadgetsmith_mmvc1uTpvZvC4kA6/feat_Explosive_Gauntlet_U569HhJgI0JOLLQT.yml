    value: >-
      <p>Your gauntlets can exert massive kinetic force when striking. When you
      make an attack with your Impact Gauntlet, you can choose to be pushed 10
      feet in the opposite direction of your attack. Alternatively, you can use
      a bonus action to attempt to push the target after the attack. The target
      must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be pushed 10 feet away from
      you. This movement doesn’t provoke opportunity attacks.</p>

      <p>You can use the movement effect of this gauntlet even if you’re not
      attacking a target, allowing you to push yourself in any direction
      (including upwards).</p>

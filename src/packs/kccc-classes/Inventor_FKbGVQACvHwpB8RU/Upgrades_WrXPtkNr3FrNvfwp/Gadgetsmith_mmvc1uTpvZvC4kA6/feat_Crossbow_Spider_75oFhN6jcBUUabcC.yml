      <p>You modify a crossbow to be able to aim and fire remotely. As an
      action, you can deploy a Tiny construct called a crossbow spider (see the
      construct’s statistics below). Once deployed, you can use a bonus action
      to cause the construct to move up to its speed and make a crossbow attack
      from its location. The construct becomes inactive after 1 minute, or after
      it has been used to make 10 attacks.</p>

      <p>Once you have activated the construct, you can’t activate it again
      until you finish a long rest, unless you expend a spell slot of 1st level
      or higher to activate it again. If the construct is destroyed, you can’t
      activate it again until you repair it or recreate it during a long
      rest.</p>

      <p>The construct can’t take any actions besides the ones you direct it to
      take with your bonus action.</p>

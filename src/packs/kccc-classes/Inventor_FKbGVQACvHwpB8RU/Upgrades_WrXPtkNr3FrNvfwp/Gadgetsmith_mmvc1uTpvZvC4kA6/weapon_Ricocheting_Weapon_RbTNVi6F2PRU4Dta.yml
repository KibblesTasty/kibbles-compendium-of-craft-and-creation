      <p>You create a thrown melee weapon enchanted or engineered to ricochet
      off its targets and return to your hand. You have proficiency with this
      weapon, which has a normal range of 30 feet and a long range of 90 feet,
      and it has the finesse and thrown properties, as well as the special
      property (described below). It deals 1d8 bludgeoning, piercing, or
      slashing damage on a hit (your choice when you choose this upgrade). You
      can Arcane Retrofit this weapon.</p>

      <p><strong>Special.</strong> When this weapon is thrown, you can target
      two creatures within 10 feet of each other, making a separate attack roll
      against each target; the damage dealt by the attack is halved for each
      target hit after the first. In addition, the weapon flies back to your
      hand immediately after the attack.</p>

      <p>You build a device that allows you to fly, such as deployable
      artificial wings. You can activate this device as a bonus action, or as a
      reaction when you fall. Whatever form the device takes, when itâ€™s
      activated, you gain a flying speed of 30 feet, which lasts until you
      choose to deactivate it (no action required).</p>

      ricochet off its targets and return to your hand. You have proficiency
      with this weapon, which has a normal range of 30 feet and a long range of
      90 feet, and it has the finesse and thrown properties, as well as the
      special property (described below). It deals 1d8 bludgeoning, piercing, or
      slashing damage on a hit (your choice when you choose this upgrade). You
      can Arcane Retrofit this weapon.</p><p><strong>Special.</strong> When this
      weapon is thrown, you can target two creatures within 10 feet of each
      other, making a separate attack roll against each target; the damage dealt
      by the attack is halved for each target hit after the first. In addition,
      the weapon flies back to your hand immediately after the attack.</p>

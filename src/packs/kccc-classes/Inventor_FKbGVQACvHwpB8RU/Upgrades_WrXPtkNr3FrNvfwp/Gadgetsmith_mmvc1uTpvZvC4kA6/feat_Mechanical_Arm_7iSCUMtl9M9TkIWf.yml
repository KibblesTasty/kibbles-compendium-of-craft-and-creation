    value: >-
      <p>You create a mechanical arm, giving you an extra hand. This mechanical
      arm only functions while it is mounted on gear you are wearing, but can be
      operated mentally without the need for your hands. This mechanical arm can
      serve any function a normal hand could, such as holding things, making
      attacks, and interacting with the environment, but it doesn’t grant you
      any additional actions.</p>

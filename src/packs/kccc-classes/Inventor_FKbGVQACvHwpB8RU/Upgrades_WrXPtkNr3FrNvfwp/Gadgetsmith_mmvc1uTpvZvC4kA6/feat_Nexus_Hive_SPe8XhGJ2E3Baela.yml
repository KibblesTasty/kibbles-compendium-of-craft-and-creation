    value: >-
      <p>You create a floating metal sphere, that when activated spews a storm
      of metal shards in all directions around it. As an action you can deploy a
      small construct (see the construct’s statistics below), throwing it up to
      30 feet where it will hover in place. Once deployed you can use a bonus
      action to move the Nexus Hive up to 20 ft. The construct becomes inactive
      after 1 minute. If the construct is destroyed, you can’t activate it again
      until you repair it or recreate it during a long rest.</p>

      <p>The construct can’t take any actions besides the ones you direct it to
      take with your bonus action.</p>

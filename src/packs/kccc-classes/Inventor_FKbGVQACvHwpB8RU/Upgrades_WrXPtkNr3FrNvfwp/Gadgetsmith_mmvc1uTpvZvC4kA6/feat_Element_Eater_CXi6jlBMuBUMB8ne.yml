      <p>You create a device capable of absorbing incoming elemental damage. You
      can activate this device as a reaction when you take acid, cold, fire,
      lightning or thunder damage. The device grants you resistance to the
      triggering damage type until the start of your next turn. After triggering
      it, the first time you hit with a melee attack on your next turn, the
      target takes an extra 1d6 elemental damage of the triggering type. Once
      use, this gadget canâ€™t be used again until you finish a short or long
      rest.</p>

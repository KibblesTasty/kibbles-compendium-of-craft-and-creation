    value: >-
      <p>You create a set of antimagical shackles. As an action when you are
      adjacent to a creature, you can attempt to shackle the creature to
      yourself or a nearby object using these shackles. Make a Dexterity
      (Sleight of Hand) check contested by the target’s Strength (Athletics) or
      Dexterity (Acrobatics) check (target’s choice). A creature that is immune
      to being grappled or restrained automatically succeeds on this check. If
      you succeed, the target is shackled to you or the nearby object, and it
      can only move if it’s able to move what it’s shackled to.</p>

      <p>Additionally, while shackled in this way, the target can’t teleport,
      travel to another plane of existence, alter its form (such as by the
      polymorph spell), or dematerialize. As an action, the target can make a
      Strength saving throw against your spell save DC, breaking the shackles on
      a success; otherwise, the shackles last until you remove them.</p>

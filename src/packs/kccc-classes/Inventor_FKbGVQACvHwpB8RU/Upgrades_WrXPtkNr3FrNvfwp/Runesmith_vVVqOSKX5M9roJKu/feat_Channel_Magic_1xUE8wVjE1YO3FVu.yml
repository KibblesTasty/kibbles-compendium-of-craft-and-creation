    value: >-
      <p>You can cast a spell with a range of touch on a creature marked by one
      of your runes, wearing armor marked by one of your runes, or wielding a
      weapon marked by one of your runes, regardless of the distance between
      you.</p>

      <p>Additionally, when you cast a spell the rune grants, you can use the
      marked creature as the point of origin for that spell.</p>

  description:
    value: "<p>As an action, you can place a special runic mark on a creature or armor. This mark lasts until you mark it again or take a long rest. While the rune is on that creature, you can cast @Compendium[dnd5e.spells.ReMbjfeOKoSj3O79]{Stoneskin} targeting that creature as a bonus action without requiring any material components.\_</p>\n<p>You can cast it this way without expending a slot once, after which you canâ€™t cast it without a spell slot again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>"

      <p>As an action, you can place a special runic mark on a creature or
      armor. This mark lasts until you mark it again or take a long rest. While
      the rune is on that creature, you can cast enlarge/reduce targeting that
      creature as a bonus action. You can cast it this way without expending a
      spell slot once, after which you can’t cast that spell in this way again
      until you finish a short or long rest. You can cast it again using spell
      slots.</p>

      <p><em>(Prerequisite: Lightning Burst)</em></p>

      <p>When you use the Lightning Burst ability, you can opt to expend a spell
      slot of 1st level or higher to infuse yourself into the burst of power.
      When you do so you are teleported up to 60 feet in the direction of the
      Lightning Burst (ending early if the Lighting Burst is blocked by an
      obstacle). You can stop anywhere along the path of the Lighting Burst, but
      the line will stop where you do.</p>

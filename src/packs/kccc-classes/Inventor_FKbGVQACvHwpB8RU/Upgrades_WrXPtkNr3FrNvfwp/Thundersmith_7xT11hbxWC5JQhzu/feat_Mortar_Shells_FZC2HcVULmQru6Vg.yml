      <p><em>(Prerequisite: Stormforged weapon with the Ammunition
      property)</em></p>

      <p>You build an alternate fire mode allowing you to fire your Stormforged
      Weapon like a mortar. Pick a target point within range, and make an attack
      roll. Apply the attack roll to all creatures within a 5-foot radius of the
      target point. Creatures hit take the weapon's damage plus half of the
      Thundermonger bonus damage. Dealing damage this way counts as applying
      Thundermonger damage for the turn. If you miss all targets, you can apply
      Devestating Blasts as normal.</p>

      <p>Creatures do not benefit from cover against this fire mode unless they
      have overhead cover as well.</p>

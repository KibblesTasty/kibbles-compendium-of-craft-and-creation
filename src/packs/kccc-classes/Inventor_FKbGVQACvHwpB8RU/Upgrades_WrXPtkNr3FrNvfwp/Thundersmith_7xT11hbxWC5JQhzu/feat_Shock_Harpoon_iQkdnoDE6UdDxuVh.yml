      <p><em>(Prerequisite: Harpoon Reel)</em></p>

      <p>After hitting a creature with the Harpoon fire mode, you can use a
      bonus action to deliver a shock. If you have not dealt Thundermonger
      damage since the start of your turn, you can deal damage equal to your
      Thundermonger bonus damage as lightning damage. This counts as discharging
      your Thundermonger damage. Additionally, the target must make a
      Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC or be stunned until
      the end of its next turn.</p>

      <p>Once used, the Harpoon must be reeled in before this can be used
      again.</p>

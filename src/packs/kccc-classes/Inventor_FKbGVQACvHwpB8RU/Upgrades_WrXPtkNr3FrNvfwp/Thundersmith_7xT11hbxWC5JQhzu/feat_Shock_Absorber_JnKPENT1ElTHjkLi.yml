      <p>You add a reclamation device to your Stormforged Weapon to gather
      energy from the surroundings when it is present. As a reaction to taking
      Lightning or Thunder damage, you can gain resistance to that damage type
      until the start of your next turn. When you do so, the next time you roll
      Thundermonger damage before the end of your next turn, it deals an extra
      1d6 damage.</p>

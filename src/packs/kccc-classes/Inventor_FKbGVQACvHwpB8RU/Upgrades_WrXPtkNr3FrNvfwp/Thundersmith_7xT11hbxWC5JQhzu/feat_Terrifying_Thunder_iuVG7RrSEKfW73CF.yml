      <p>You add an additional amplifier to maximize the shock and awe value of
      your Stormforged Weapon. The first time a target takes damage from
      Thundermonger, they are deafened until the end of their next turn.</p>

      <p>Additionally, they must make a Wisdom saving throw against your spell
      save DC or become frightened of you for one minute. They can repeat this
      saving throw at the end of each of their turns.</p>

      <p>On a successful saving throw, the creature is immune to Terrifying

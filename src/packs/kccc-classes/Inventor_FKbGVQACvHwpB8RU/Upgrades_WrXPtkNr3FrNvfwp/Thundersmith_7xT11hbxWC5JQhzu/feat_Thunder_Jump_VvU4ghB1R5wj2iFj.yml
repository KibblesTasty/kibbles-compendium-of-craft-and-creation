    value: >-
      <p>You build a quick release for the arcane thundering energy that fills
      your Stormforged Weapon. As an action you can discharge your Stormforged
      Weapon downward, launching yourself up to 60 feet in any direction. This
      movement doesn’t provoke opportunity attacks, and you carry up to one
      willing creature of your choice within 5 feet with you. Neither you or the
      carried creature takes falling damage on landing.</p>

      <p>Creatures that are within 10 feet of you when you use this ability must
      make a Dexterity saving throw against your spell save DC. On failure, they
      take damage equal to half of your Thundermonger damage. On success, they
      take half as much damage. This counts as discharging your Thundermonger
      damage. Firing in this way doesn’t consume ammo.</p>

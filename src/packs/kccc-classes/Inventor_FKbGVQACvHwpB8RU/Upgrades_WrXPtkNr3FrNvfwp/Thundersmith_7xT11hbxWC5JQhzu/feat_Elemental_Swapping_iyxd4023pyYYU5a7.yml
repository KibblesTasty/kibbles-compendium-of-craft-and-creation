      <p>You upgrade the firing chamber for more adaptable damage. When you take
      the attack action with your Stormforged Weapon you can adjust its
      elemental properties, causing any bonus damage granted by Thundermonger to
      deal acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder damage instead of thunder
      damage. Alternatively, you can use a vial of holy water to cause your next
      Thundermonger bonus damage to deal radiant damage.</p>

    value: >-
      <p>When making a ranged weapon attack with your Stormforged Weapon, if
      neither you nor your target has moved since your last ranged attack
      against them, then you gain advantage on the attack. Also, being prone no
      longer causes you to have disadvantage when making a ranged weapon attack
      with your Stormforged Weapon.</p>

      <p><em>(Prerequisite: Storm Blast or Lightning Burst)</em></p>

      <p>Before making an attack with your Stormforged Weapon, you can expend a
      spell slot of 3rd level or higher to use Storm Blast or Lightning Burst at
      the same time as making an attack; in this case the Storm Blast or
      Lightning Burst is powered by the spell slot and doesn’t count as applying
      Thundermonger for that turn. The direction of this secondary ability is
      the same as your attack.</p>

      <p>Doing this damages your Stormforged Weapon and you must spend an action
      to repair it before you can fire again. You must have the secondary
      ability unlocked as an upgrade to use it.</p>

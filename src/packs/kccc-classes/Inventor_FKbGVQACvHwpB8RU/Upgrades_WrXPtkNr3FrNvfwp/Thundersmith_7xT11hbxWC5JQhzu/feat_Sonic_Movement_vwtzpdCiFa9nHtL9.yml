    value: >-
      <p>You recalibrate and rebalance your weapon to leverage the backdraft of
      the force it exerts. When you make an attack with your Stormforged weapon
      that would deal thunder damage on your turn, you are knocked 5 feet away
      from the target you attacked. This movement doesn’t provoke opportunity
      attacks.</p>

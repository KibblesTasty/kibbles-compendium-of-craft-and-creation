      <p>You upgrade your Stormforged Weapon to discharge its power within a
      5-foot-wide 60-foot-long line. If you have not dealt Thundermonger damage
      since the start of your turn, as an action, you can make a special attack.
      Each creature in the area must make a Dexterity saving throw against your
      spell save DC or take damage equal to the bonus damage of Thundermonger as
      lightning damage on a failed save, half as much on a successful save.</p>

      <p>This counts as discharging your Thundermonger damage. Firing in this
      way doesn’t consume ammo.</p>

      <p><em>(Prerequisite: Sentient Armor)</em></p>

      <p>The intelligence in your armor will attempt to preserve your life. If
      you are incapacitated or unconscious and can’t take your action, it will
      cast a spell or take the dodge action. It can only cast spells granted by
      your armor’s upgrades, and can use your spell slots to do so. It can act
      in this way up a number of turns equal to your Intelligence modifier, but
      this control strains its abilities, and it can’t take control again until
      you finish a short or long rest. You automatically resume control if you
      are no longer incapacitated or unconscious.</p>

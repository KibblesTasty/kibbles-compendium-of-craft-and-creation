  description:
    value: >-
      <p>As an action, you can activate active camouflage, causing your
      Warsmithâ€™s Armor to automatically blend into its surroundings. This lasts
      until deactivated. While this is active, you are considered lightly
      obscured, and can hide from a creature even when they have a clear line of
      sight to you. Wisdom (Perception) checks to find you that rely on vision
      are made with disadvantage.</p>

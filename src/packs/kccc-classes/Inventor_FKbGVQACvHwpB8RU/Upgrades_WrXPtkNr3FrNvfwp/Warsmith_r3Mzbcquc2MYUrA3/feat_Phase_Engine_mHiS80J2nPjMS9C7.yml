      <p><em>(Prerequisite: Warskin or Warsuit)</em></p>

      <p>When you are attacked, you can use your reaction to become intangible,
      causing that attack to miss if it is a nonmagical attack, or to have
      disadvantage if it is a magical attack. Once you do so, you canâ€™t do so
      again until you finish a short or long rest, or until you teleport or
      enter the ethereal plane.</p>

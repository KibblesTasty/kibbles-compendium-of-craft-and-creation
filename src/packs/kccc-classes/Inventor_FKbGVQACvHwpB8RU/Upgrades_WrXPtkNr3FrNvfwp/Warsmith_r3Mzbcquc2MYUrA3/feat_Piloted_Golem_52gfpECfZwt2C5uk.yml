    value: >-
      <p><em>(Prerequisite: Warplate, 9th-level inventor; incompatible with
      Collapsible and Flight)</em></p>

      <p>You enlarge your Warplate, turning it into a piloted mechanical golem.
      Your size category when wearing the armor increases by one.</p>

      <p>You have advantage on Strength saving throws and Strength checks
      against creatures the same size as you or smaller than you, but you have
      disadvantage on Dexterity saving throws and Dexterity checks (including
      initiative rolls). At the end of a short or long rest, your Warplate gains
      temporary hit points equal to your Inventor level.</p>

      <p>You are no longer a valid target for spells that require a humanoid
      target, but can be targeted by spells that require a construct target
      while wearing this armor.</p>

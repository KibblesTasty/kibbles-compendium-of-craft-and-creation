    value: >-
      <p>Your Warsmith’s armor gains an integrated grappling reel set into your
      gauntlet. As an attack or as an action, you may target a surface, object
      or creature within 30 feet. If the target is Large or smaller, you can
      make a Strength (Athletics) check as if grappling normally to pull it to
      you and grapple it on success. Alternatively, if the target is Large or
      larger, you can choose to be pulled to it (this doesn’t grapple it). This
      movement provokes opportunity attacks as normal movement would.</p>

      <p><em>(Prerequisite: Warplate)</em></p>

      <p>As a bonus action on your turn you can environmentally seal your
      Warplate, giving you an air supply for up to 1 hour and making you immune
      to poison (but not curing you of existing poisoned conditions).</p>

      <p>In addition to the above, you are also considered acclimated to cold
      and hot climates while wearing your armor, and you’re also acclimated to
      high altitude while wearing your armor.</p>

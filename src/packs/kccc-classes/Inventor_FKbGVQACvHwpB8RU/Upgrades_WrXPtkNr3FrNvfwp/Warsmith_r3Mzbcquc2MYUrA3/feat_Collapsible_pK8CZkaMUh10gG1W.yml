      <p><em>(Incompatible with Integrated Armor)</em></p>

      <p>Your Warsmith’s armor can collapse into a case for easy storage. When
      transformed this way the armor is indistinguishable from a normal case and
      weighs 1/3 its normal weight. As an action you can don or doff the armor,
      allowing it to transform as needed.</p>

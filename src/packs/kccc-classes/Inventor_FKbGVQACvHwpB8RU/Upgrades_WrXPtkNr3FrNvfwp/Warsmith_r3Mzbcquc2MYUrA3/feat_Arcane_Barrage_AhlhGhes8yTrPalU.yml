  description:
    value: >-
      <p>Your armor collects arcane energy whenever you expend a spell slot,
      storing a number of charges equal to the level of the spell cast. These
      charges fade after 1 minute if you do not expend additional spell slots.
      You can store a maximum number of charges equal to half your Inventor
      level. You can use this upgrade to cast magic missile without expending a
      spell slot. This expends all charges, increasing the level of the magic
      missile spell by one for each charge spent. If you have an Ether Reactor,
      you can expend charges from it to add additional charges, up to the
      maximum number of charges you can have stored.</p>

      <p>Once activated, it canâ€™t be used again until you finish a short or long
      rest.</p>

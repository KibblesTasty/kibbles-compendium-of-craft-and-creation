    value: >-
      <p>Your Warsuit gains an integrated grappling hook set into your gauntlet.
      As an attack or as an action, you may target a surface, object or creature
      within 20 feet. If the target is Small or smaller, you can make a Strength
      (Athletics) grappling check to pull it to you and grapple it.
      Alternatively, if the target is Medium or larger, you can choose to be
      pulled to it (this doesn’t grapple it). Opportunity attacks provoked by
      this movement are made with disadvantage.</p>

      <p><em>(You can take this upgrade multiple times, selecting a different
      option each time.)</em></p>

      <p>You magically enchant your visor. You gain one of the following effects
      while wearing your armor; you pick the effect when selecting the
      upgrade.</p>

      <ul>

      <li>You gain darkvision to a range of 60 feet. If you already have
      darkvision, the range of that darkvision is increased by 60 feet.</li>

      <li>You can ignore Sunlight Sensitivity.</li>

      <li>Divination spells no longer require your concentration to maintain.
      You can only use this effect on one spell at a time.</li>

      </ul>

      <p>Regardless of the selection, you have advantage on saving throws
      against being blinded while wearing your armor.</p>

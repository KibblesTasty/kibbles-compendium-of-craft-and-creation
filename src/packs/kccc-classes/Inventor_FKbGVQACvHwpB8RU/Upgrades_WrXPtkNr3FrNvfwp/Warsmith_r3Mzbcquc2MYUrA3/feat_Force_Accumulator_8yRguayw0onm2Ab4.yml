    value: >-
      <p><em>(Prerequisite: Force Blast)</em></p>

      <p>Every time you expend a spell slot of 1st level or higher, you
      accumulate charges to your Force Blast equal to the level of spell slot
      spent, up to a maximum number of charges equal to half of your
      Intelligence modifier (rounded down). When you deal damage with Force
      Blast, you can expend the accumulated charges to deal an extra 1d6 damage
      or to move the target 5 feet directly away from you, or any combination
      thereof per charge spent.</p>

      <p>Charges not expended within 1 minute of being accumulated are lost.</p>

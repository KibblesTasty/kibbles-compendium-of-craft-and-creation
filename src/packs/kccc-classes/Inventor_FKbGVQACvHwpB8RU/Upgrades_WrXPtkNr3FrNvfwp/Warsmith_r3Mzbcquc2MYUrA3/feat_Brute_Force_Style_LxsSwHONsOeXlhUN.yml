      <p>The strength imparted by your armor gives the force of blows the
      devastating power of a more skilled combatant. You can select a Fighting
      Style from Duelist, Great Weapon Fighting, or Two-Weapon Fighting and gain
      the effect of that Fighting Style while wearing your armor.</p>

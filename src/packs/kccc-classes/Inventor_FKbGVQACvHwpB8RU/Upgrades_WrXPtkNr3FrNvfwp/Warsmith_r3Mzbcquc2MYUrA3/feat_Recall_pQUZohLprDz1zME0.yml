    value: >-
      <p>When not being worn you can hide your Warsmith’s Armor in a pocket
      dimension. As an action you can magically summon the armor and don it. You
      can use a bonus action to return the armor to the pocket dimension.</p>

      <p>While in the pocket dimension the armor can’t be affected by other
      abilities and can’t be interacted with in any way.</p>

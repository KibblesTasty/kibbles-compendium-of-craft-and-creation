      <p>You create an artificial personality integrated into your armor, giving
      it limited sentience. This sentience assists you in many ways. While
      wearing your armor, your Intelligence ability score and maximum
      Intelligence ability score are increased by 2. Your armor can understand
      and speak any language you can speak. You can communicate telepathically
      with it while wearing it.</p>

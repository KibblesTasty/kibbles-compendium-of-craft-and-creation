      <p><em>(Prerequisite: Arcane Visor, Sentient Armor)</em></p>

      <p>You can delegate displaying and tracking things in your sight to your
      Sentient armor, granting you the following benefits:</p>

      <ul>

      <li>When a creature attempts to take the Hide action against you, you can
      make an active Wisdom (Perception) check to contest its Dexterity
      (Stealth) check as a reaction.</li>

      <li>When making a Dexterity saving throw against an attack you can see,
      you can make an Intelligence saving throw instead.</li>

      <li>When a creature hits you with a ranged attack roll, you can cast true
      strike as a reaction targeting that creature.</li>

      </ul>

      <p><em>(Prerequisite: Piloted Golem)</em></p>

      <p>You integrate a shield into one of your armorâ€™s arms. You have
      proficiency with that shield, and can deploy it as a bonus action. It
      requires the use of that arm while deployed.</p>

      <p>Additionally, when you shove a Medium or smaller creature while you
      have the shield deployed, you can shove it by slamming it with the
      attached shield causing it to take damage equal to your Strength
      modifier.</p>

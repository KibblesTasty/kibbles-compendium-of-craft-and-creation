      <p><em>(Prerequisite: Warskin or Warsuit)</em></p>

      <p>You gain the ability to cast
      @Compendium[dnd5e.spells.wqfAVANuQonNBgnL]{Misty Step} and
      @Compendium[dnd5e.spells.GSvLWcdCZLQkilXT]{Blink} while wearing your
      Warsuit. Additionally, as an action, you can become intangible, and move
      through creatures or objects until the end of your turn. If you end your
      turn inside a creature or object, you are forced to the nearest unoccupied
      location, taking 2 force damage for each foot you are forced to move. Once
      you become intangible using this upgrade, you canâ€™t do so again until you
      finish a short or long rest.</p>

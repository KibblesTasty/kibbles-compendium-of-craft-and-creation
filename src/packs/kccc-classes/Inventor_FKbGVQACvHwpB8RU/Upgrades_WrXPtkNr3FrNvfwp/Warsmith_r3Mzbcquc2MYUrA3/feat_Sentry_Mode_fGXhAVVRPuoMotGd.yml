      <p><em>(Prerequisite: Piloted Golem)</em></p>

      <p>As a bonus action deploy stabilizers, reducing your speed to zero but
      granting your better stability and focus. Until you end the effect as an
      action, your reach and range are both doubled with all weapons and you can
      make an opportunity attack against a creature that moves more than 5 feet
      within range of one of your equipped weapons (melee or ranged).</p>

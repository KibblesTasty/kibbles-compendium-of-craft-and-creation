      <p><em>(Prerequisite: An Ingenious Reliquary that is a weapon)</em></p>

      <p>You invoke the power of your Relic weapon to attempt to purge a
      creature. When you hit a creature with your Relic weapon you may have the
      creature make a Strength saving throw. On a failure it becomes restrained
      by chains of fire and set ablaze. While restrained, it takes [[/damage 2d6
      fire]] damage at the start of each of its turns. It may repeat the saving
      throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success.</p>

      <p>Once you invoke this ability, you can’t do so again until you finish a
      short or long rest.</p>

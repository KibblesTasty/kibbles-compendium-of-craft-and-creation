  description:
    value: "<p><em>\_(Prerequisite: Relic Lantern)</em></p>\n<p>You snuff the light of your lantern, plunging the area around you into darkness. Creatures of your choice within the area that was illuminated by your lanter must make a Wisdom saving throw. On failure, they take [[/damage 8d6 necrotic]] damage, and half as much on a success. If extinguishing your lantern would leave the creature blinded by darkness, they make the saving throw with disadvantage. Your lantern does not emit light until the start of your next turn.</p>\n<p>Once you use this feature, you cannot do so again until you complete a long rest.\_</p>"

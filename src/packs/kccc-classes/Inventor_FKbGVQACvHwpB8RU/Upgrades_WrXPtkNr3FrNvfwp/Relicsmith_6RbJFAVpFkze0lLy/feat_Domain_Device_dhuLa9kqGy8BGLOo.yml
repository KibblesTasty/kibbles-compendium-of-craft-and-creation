    value: >-
      <p>With careful inscription and rituals you create a divine device that
      focuses the holy power of a particular domain. At the time of selecting
      this upgrade, select a cleric domain. This device can be used to activate
      that domain’s Channel Divinity feature once, after which it can’t be used
      again until you finish a long rest. Your Inventor level is your Cleric
      level for the purpose of calculating any bonuses to it.</p>

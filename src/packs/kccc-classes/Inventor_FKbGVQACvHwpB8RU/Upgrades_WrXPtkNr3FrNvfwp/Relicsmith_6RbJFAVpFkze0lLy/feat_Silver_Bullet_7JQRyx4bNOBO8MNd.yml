  description:
    value: >-
      <p>During a long rest you can create a single piece of ammunition
      specialized in the destruction of one creature type. Select from
      aberration, celestial, fiend, shapechanger, or undead. The piece of
      ammunition is considered silvered and magical for the purposes of
      bypassing resistance. If this piece of ammunition hits the specified
      creature type, the hit becomes a critical hit, and the piece of ammunition
      becomes a normal piece of ammunition. You can only have one special piece
      of ammunition from this feature at a time.</p>

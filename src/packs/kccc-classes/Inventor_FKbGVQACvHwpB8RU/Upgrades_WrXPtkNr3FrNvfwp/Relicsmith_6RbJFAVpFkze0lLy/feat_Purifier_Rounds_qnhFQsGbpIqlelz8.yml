  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You can make a number of pieces of ammunition equal to your
      Intelligence modifier imbued with special divine power. On hit, these
      rounds do deal an extra [[/damage 1d6 radiant]] damage. If the creature is
      undead or a fiend and the damage from this round reduces its hit points to
      a number less than your Inventor level, it has to make a Charisma saving
      throw. On failure, it dies and explodes to ash.</p>

      <p>You can replenish any spent rounds after a long rest.</p>

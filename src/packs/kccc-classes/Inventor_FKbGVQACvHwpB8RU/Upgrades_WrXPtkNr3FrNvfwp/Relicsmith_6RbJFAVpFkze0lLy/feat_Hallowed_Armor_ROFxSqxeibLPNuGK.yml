    value: >-
      <p>You mark your armor with hallowed inscriptions. When you gain temporary
      hit points from one of your spells or class features, you glow with
      radiance. The next time you deal radiant or fire damage with an attack,
      you deal additional damage equal to the temporary hit points gained.</p>

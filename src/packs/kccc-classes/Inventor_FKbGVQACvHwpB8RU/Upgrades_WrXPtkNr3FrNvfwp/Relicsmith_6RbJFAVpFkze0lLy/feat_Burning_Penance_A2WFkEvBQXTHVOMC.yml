  description:
    value: "<p><em>(Prerequisite: Path of Penance)</em></p>\n<p>Whenever a creature rolls the [[/r d4]] from the effect of a bane spell you have afflicted on them, they take fire damage equal to the value rolled on the die.</p>\n<p>Additionally, when you deal fire damage, you gain temporary hit points equal to the fire damage dealt, to a maximum of your proficiency bonus. Once you gain temporary hit points this way, you can’t gain them again until the start of your next turn.</p>\n<p>\_</p>"

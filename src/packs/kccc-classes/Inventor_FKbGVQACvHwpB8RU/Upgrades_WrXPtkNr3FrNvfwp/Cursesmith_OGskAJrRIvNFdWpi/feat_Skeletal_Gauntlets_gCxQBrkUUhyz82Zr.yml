      <p>(You can only wear 1 set of Gauntlets at a time.)</p>

      <p>You forge a pair of gauntlets that cause your hands to appear as
      skeletal appendages of dark metal. While wearing these gauntlets, if you
      grapple a creature, at the start of its turn it takes 1d6 necrotic damage,
      and canâ€™t regain hit points until the start of its next turn.
      Additionally, you have advantage against any check or save that would
      disarm you.</p>

      <p>While wearing these gauntlets, you can cast the
      @Compendium[kibbles-compendium-of-craft-and-creation.kccc-spells.vIG4qHxOD5NmLbcA]{Grip
      of the Dead} spell.</p>

      <p><strong>Curse:</strong> The death grip of these gloves make it
      difficult to let go of things. You have disadvantage on attacks made by
      throwing weapons or with weapons with the ammunition property.
      Additionally, you have disadvantage on any ability check to throw an
      item.</p>

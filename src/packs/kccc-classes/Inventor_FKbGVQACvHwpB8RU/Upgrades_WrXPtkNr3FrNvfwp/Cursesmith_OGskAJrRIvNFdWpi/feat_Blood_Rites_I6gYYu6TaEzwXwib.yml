    value: >-
      <p>Delving your dark path, you formulate a way to form temporary
      containers of magical power using blood. Select three ritual spells from
      the Wizard spell list; you gain the ability to cast these spells as Ritual
      Spells. You can only take spells of a level you could normally cast at the
      level you take this Upgrade.</p>

      <p>To cast these spells as rituals, you require fresh blood; this can be
      provided by a creature that has been slain in the last hour, or by a
      creature (including yourself) providing it at a cost of 1d4 slashing
      damage (This damage can’t be reduced or prevented).</p>

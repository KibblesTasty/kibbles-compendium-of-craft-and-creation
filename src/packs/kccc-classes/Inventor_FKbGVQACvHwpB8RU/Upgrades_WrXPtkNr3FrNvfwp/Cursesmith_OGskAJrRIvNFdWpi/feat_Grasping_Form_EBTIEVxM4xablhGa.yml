    value: >-
      <p>You Forbidden Artifact can twist around, binding targets. When you hit
      an attack with it, you can attempt to grapple the target as a bonus
      action. If you have the Abhorrent Life property, you can make an
      Intelligence (Athletics) check to initiate or sustain the grapple. You
      canâ€™t attack other creatures while grappling a creature with this
      weapon.</p>

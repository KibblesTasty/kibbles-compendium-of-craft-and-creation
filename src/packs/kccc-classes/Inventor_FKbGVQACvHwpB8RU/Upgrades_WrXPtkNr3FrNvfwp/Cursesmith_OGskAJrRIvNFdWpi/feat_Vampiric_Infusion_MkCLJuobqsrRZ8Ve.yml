    value: >-
      <p>You develop a dark infusion you can work upon a weapon. As a bonus
      action, you can expend a spell slot to infuse a weapon you touch with
      vampiric thirst for the next minute. When the wielder of the weapon rolls
      damage with a weapon attack using the infused weapon, they deal 1d8
      additional necrotic damage, and regain hit points equal to the necrotic
      damage dealt + your Intelligence modifier. This effect can occur a number
      of times equal to the spell slot used on the infusion.</p>

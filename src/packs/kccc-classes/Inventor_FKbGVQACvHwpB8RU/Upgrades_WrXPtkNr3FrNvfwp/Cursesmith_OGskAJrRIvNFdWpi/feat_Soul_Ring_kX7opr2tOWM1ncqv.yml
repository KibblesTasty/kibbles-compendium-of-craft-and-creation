      <p>You create a ring to store your soul. While wearing this ring, you have
      advantage on death saving throws. You can absorb yourself, your body, and
      equipment into the ring. When you do so, it gains weight equal to one
      tenth of your weight (including your equipment). While absorbed into the
      ring, you share the senses of a creature wearing the ring, and communicate
      telepathically with them, but are otherwise only have a blindsight of 5
      feet, and cannot take any actions that would require you to have a body.
      You exit the ring as an action, appearing within 5 feet of the ring.</p>

      <p>While another creature is wearing the ring, you can attempt to possess
      them. They make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, they fall under
      the effect of a @Compendium[dnd5e.spells.eEpy1ONlXumKS1mp]{Dominate
      Monster} spell as if you had cast it. Your body disappears (if it was not
      already absorbed into the ring, and you cannot take any actions other than
      to control the dominated creature (as per the spell). A creature can
      choose to fail their save against this.</p>

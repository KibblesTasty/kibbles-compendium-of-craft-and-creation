      <p>(Prerequisite: Curse Bringer)</p>

      <p>If a target becomes affected by bane (either the spell or the effect
      from Curse Bringer) you can force a creature within 5 feet of it to make a
      Charisma saving throw against the same effect, repeating indefinitely as
      long as you are affecting any creature (besides yourself) with bane. If a
      target fails their save, they become affected by the same effect as the
      initial target.</p>

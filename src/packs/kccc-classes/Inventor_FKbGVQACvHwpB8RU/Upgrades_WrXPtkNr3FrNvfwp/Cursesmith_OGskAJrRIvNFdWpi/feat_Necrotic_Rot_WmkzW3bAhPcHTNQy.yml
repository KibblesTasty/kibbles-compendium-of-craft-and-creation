  description:
    value: >-
      <p>The weapon is enshrouded in dark energy. Each time you hit a creature
      with it, it inflicts a stack of necrotic rot on the creature. At the end
      of that creature’s turn it takes 1d4 damage per stack of necrotic rot on
      it and makes a Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC. On a
      success, all stacks are removed. You can have a maximum number of stacks
      on a creature equal to your proficiency modifier.</p>

  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You allow the power of your artifact to leak out. Whenever you cast a
      spell of 1st level or higher, you become heavily obscured by dark shadowy
      flames for a number of rounds equal to the level of the spell (for
      example, a 1st-level spell the flames shroud you until the start of your
      next turn). While you are shrouded in these flames, any creature within 5
      feet of you that hits you with an attack takes 2d8 necrotic damage.</p>

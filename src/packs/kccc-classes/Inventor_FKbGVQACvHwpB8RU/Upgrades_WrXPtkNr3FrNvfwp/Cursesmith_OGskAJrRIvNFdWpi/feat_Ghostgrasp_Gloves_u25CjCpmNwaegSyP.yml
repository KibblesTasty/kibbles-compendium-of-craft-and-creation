      <p><em>(You can only wear 1 set of Gauntlets at a time.)</em></p>

      <p><em>Cursed, Attunement</em></p>

      <p>When you pull on these pale white gloves, your hands become ethereal,
      ghostlike appendages that drift and float from your wrists. You can
      interact with objects with your hands with a range of 10 feet, including
      picking up objects, opening doors, or grappling foes; you can attack with
      these hands at that range only if wielding light weapons.</p>

      <p><strong>Curse:</strong> You have disadvantage on grappling checks and
      the amount you can lift or drag with your hands is halved as things slip
      through them.</p>

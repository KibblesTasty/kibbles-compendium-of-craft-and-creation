    value: >-
      <p>As an action, you can expend a spell slot to assume the form of a fiend
      from the following list. The transformation lasts for a number of rounds
      equal to your spellcasting ability modifier + your proficiency bonus and
      requires your concentration to maintain, as if concentrating on a spell,
      or until you drop to 0 hit points or die. The new form can be a fiend from
      the following table based on the level of spell slot spent. Your game
      statistics, excluding mental ability scores, are replaced by the
      statistics of the chosen fiend. You retain your alignment and
      personality.</p>

      <p>You assume the hit points of your new form. When you revert to your
      normal form, you return to the number of hit points you had before you
      transformed. If you revert as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any
      excess damage carries over to your normal form. As long as the excess
      damage doesn’t reduce your normal form to 0 hit points, you aren’t knocked
      unconscious.</p>

      <p>You do not gain any spells the form can cast, legendary actions, or
      legendary resistances it might have. Your gear melds into the new form.
      The creature can’t activate, use, wield, or otherwise benefit from any of
      its equipment.</p>

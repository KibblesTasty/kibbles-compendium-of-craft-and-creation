      <p><em>(Prerequisite: Artifact with the Eldritch Eruption
      upgrade)</em></p>

      <p>Select a cantrip with a spell attack roll from the Wizard spell list
      that deals the same damage type as your weapon (when awakened). Once per
      turn, you can apply the secondary effect of that cantrip to your weapon’s
      attack roll (for example, applying chill touch’s secondary effect to a
      weapon that deals necrotic damage).</p>

      <p><em>Attunement, Cursed</em></p>

      <p>You forge a magical mantle by seeping it in the blood beasts. By
      dipping it in the blood of a beast slain within the past week, you can
      gain one trait of that beast for an hour while wearing the mantle (such as
      Keen Senses or Spider Climb).</p>

      <p><strong>Curse:</strong> When you activate its power by dipping it in
      the blood of a beast, the languages you can speak become the languages the
      beast could speak (you still can understand any language you could
      previously understand) until the effect ends.</p>

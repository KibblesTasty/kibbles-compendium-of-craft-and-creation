    value: >-
      <p>You create a ring that can store a fragment of corrupted power. As an
      action, you can infuse an Inventor spell you know (including spells gained
      from upgrades) with a casting time of 1 action into the ring. You cast the
      spell as normal (expending the spell slot if it is 1st level or higher)
      but the spell doesn’t take effect, and is stored in the ring for later
      use. When you take the Attack action while a spell is stored in your ring,
      you may replace one attack with the stored spell. You may also release the
      stored spell directly, casting it at its normal casting time. A stored
      spell fades if you remove the ring, or if it is unused at the end of a
      long rest.</p>

      <p><strong>Curse:</strong> When you store a spell in your ring, your
      current and maximum hit points are reduced by 1 + the level of the spell
      (1 for a cantrip).</p>

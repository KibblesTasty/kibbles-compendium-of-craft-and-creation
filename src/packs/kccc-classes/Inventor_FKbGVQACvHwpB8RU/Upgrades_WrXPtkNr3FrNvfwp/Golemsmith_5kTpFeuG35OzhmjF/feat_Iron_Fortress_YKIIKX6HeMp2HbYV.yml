      <p>You extend your golem’s shielding and stationary stability. Your golem
      now counts as three-quarters cover for creatures riding it or for
      creatures within 5 feet of it (as long as it is between the target and the
      attacker). Additionally, while your golem is on the ground, it can’t be
      moved against its will.</p>

      <p>Your Golem Companion begins to apply its abilities to learn new things,
      gaining one level in a class of your choice. Your Golem Companion gains
      all the 1st-level features of the chosen class. This doesnâ€™t include hit
      points, Hit Dice, or class proficiencies. For example, choosing the
      Fighter class grants the golem the Fighting Style and Second Wind
      features, but nothing else.</p>

      <p>You can select this upgrade multiple times, granting your golem another
      level of features from the same class or the 1st-level features from
      another class each time it is selected.</p>

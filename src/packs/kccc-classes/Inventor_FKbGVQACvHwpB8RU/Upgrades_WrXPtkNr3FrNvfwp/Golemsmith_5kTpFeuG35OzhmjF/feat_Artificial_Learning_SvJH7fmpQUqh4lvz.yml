      <p>Your Golem Companion begins to apply its abilities to learn new things,
      gaining one level in a class of your choice. Your Golem Companion gains
      all the 1st-level features of the chosen class. This doesn’t include hit
      points, Hit Dice, or class proficiencies. For example, choosing the
      Fighter class grants the golem the Fighting Style and Second Wind
      features, but nothing else.</p>

      <p>You can select this upgrade multiple times, granting your golem another
      level of features from the same class or the 1st-level features from
      another class each time it is selected.</p>

  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You build an improved frame and power source for your golem. Your
      golem’s Strength score increases by 2, increasing its ability to perform
      tasks that require raw strength. If this upgrade increases the golem’s
      Strength to 16 or higher, it gains proficiency in Strength saving throws;
      if this upgrade increases its Strength to 18, it gains proficiency in the
      Athletics skill.</p>

      <p>You can select this upgrade multiple times, but you can’t increase the
      golem’s Strength above 18 using this upgrade.</p>

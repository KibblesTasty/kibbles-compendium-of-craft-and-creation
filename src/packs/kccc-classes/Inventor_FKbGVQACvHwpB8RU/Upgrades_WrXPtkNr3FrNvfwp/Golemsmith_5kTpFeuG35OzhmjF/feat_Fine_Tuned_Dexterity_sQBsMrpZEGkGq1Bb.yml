    value: >-
      <p>You craft improved gears and joints for your golem. Your golem’s
      Dexterity score increases by 2, increasing its ability to perform tasks
      that require fine motor skills. If this upgrade increases the golem’s
      Dexterity to 16 or higher, it gains proficiency with thieves’ tools; if
      this upgrade increases its Dexterity to 18, it gains proficiency in the
      Stealth skill.</p>

      <p>You can select this upgrade multiple times, but you can’t increase the
      golem’s Dexterity above 18 using this upgrade.</p>

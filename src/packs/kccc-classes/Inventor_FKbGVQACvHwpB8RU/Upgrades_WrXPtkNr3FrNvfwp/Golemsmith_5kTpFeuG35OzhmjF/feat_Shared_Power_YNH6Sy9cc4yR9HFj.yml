    value: >-
      <p>You bind your golem’s power source to your own soul, allowing you to
      tap its power and it to tap your power. Your golem can use its action and
      expend one of your spell slots to cast a spell you know of the slot’s
      level or lower.</p>

      <p>In addition, you can use your action to cause your golem to lose a
      number of hit points up to twice your inventor level, granting you a
      number of temporary hit points equal to that amount.</p>

      <p>Finally, on your turn, you can forgo your action to grant your golem an
      additional action, or you can command your golem to forgo its action,
      granting yourself an additional action. That action can only be used to
      take the Attack (one weapon attack only), Dash, Disengage, Hide, or Use an
      Object action.</p>

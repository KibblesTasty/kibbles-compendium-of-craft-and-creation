    value: >-
      <p>You have reinforced your golem with layers of protection and redundant
      systems. Your golem’s Constitution score increases by 2, increasing its
      stability and durability. If this upgrade increases the golem’s
      Constitution to 16 or higher, it gains proficiency in Constitution saving
      throws; if this upgrade increases its Constitution to 18, it has advantage
      on death saving throws.</p>

      <p>You can select this upgrade multiple times, but you can’t increase the
      golem’s Constitution above 18 using this upgrade.</p>

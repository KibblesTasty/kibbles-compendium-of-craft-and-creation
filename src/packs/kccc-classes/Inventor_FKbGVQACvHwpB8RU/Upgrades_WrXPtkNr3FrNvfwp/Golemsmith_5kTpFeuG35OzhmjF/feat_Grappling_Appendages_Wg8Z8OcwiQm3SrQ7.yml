    value: >-
      <p>You install an additional pair of grappling appendages to your golem,
      which take a form of your choice. For the purpose of grappling, these
      appendages count as two additional free hands for your golem.
      Additionally, as long as your golem isn’t using these appendages to
      grapple, it has a climbing speed equal to its walking speed.</p>

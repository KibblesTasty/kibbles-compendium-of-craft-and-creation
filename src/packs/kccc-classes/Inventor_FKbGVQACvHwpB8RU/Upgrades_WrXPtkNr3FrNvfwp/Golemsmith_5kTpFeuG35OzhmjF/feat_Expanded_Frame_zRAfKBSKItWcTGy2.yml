    value: >-
      <p>You enlarge your golem, increasing its size by one category, up to a
      maximum of Large. If your golem is Large after taking this upgrade, it
      gains advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws, and its hit
      point maximum increases to 5 + [(the golem’s Constitution modifier + 6)
      times your inventor level].</p>

      <p>During the process, you can determine if your golem will have the
      appropriate anatomy to serve as a mount. You can select this upgrade
      multiple times, but you can’t increase the golem’s size above Large using
      this upgrade.</p>

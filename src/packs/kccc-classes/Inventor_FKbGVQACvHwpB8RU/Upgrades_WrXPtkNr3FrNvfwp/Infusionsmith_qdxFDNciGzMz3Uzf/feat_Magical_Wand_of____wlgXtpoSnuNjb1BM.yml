      <p>You create a new wand that you can infuse with a spell of 1st level or
      higher that you have recorded in your Spell Manual. This wand doesn’t
      require attunement, but can only be used by you. The spell must be of a
      level that you can cast as an inventor (as of when you would choose this
      upgrade). This wand has 3 charges.</p>

      <p>You can expend a charge to cast the chosen spell at its lowest level.
      The wand regains all expended charges when you finish a long rest.</p>

      <p>You can select this upgrade multiple times, choosing a different spell
      and creating a new wand each time you select this upgrade.</p>

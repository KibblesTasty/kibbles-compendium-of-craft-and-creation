      <p>Your mastery of weapon animation expands to a greater breadth of
      control. If you have two Animated Weapons, you can animate a third weapon
      with your Animate Weapon feature. When you take the Attack action and make
      an attack with your other two Animated Weapons, you can make an attack
      with your third Animated Weapon as part of the same action.</p>

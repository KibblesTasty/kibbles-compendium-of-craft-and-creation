      <p>You create a new rod that you can infuse with a spell of 5th level or
      higher that you have recorded in your Spell Manual. This rod doesn’t
      require attunement, but can only be used by you. The spell must be of a
      level no higher than half your inventor level (as of when you would choose
      this upgrade), rounded down.</p>

      <p>You can use the rod to cast the chosen spell at its lowest level. Once
      you cast the spell in this way, you can’t do so again until you finish a
      long rest. You can select this upgrade multiple times, choosing a
      different spell and creating a new rod each time you select this
      upgrade.</p>

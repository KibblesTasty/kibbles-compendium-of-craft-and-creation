    value: >-
      <p>You learn how to weave a protective enchantment on an item. That item
      gains a pool of temporary hit points equal to your inventor level. Any
      creature carrying the item gains any temporary hit points remaining in its
      pool, but these hit points are lost if that creature is no longer carrying
      the item.</p>

      <p>The item’s pool of temporary hit points replenishes when you finish a
      long rest.</p>

    value: >-
      <p>You set up a special magical bond between you and another creature.
      When either of the bonded creatures fails an Intelli-</p>

      <p>gence, Wisdom, Charisma, or death saving throw, the other creature can
      make the same saving throw, replacing the original result with its own. If
      this ability is used on a death saving throw, the roll is automatically a
      20. Once this ability has been used to replace a roll, it can’t be used
      again until both bonded creatures have finished a short or long rest.</p>

      <p>This bond can be set up with a different creature at the end of a long
      rest.</p>

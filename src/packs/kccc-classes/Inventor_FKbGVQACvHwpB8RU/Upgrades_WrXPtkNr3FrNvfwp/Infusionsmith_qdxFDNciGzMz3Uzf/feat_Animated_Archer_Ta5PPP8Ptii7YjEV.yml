    value: >-
      <p>You master animation enchantments, allowing you to use your Animate
      Weapon feature on a ranged weapon and a quiver of ammunition. An animated
      ranged weapon hovers near you, and you can make a ranged spell attack with
      it against a target within the weapon’s range.</p>

      <p>On a hit, the target takes damage equal to the weapon’s damage dice +
      your Intelligence modifier. The weapon requires ammunition, and it can
      carry up 30 pieces of ammunition at a time. You can reload the ammunition
      at any time as an action.</p>

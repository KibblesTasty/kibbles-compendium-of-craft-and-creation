  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You infuse a ranged weapon with special, arcane magic. The weapon no
      longer requires ammunition to fire, as it creates magical ammunition when
      you fire it, and whenever you hit a target with this magical ammunition,
      the attack deals force damage, instead of the weapon’s normal damage type.
      Additionally, if the weapon had the loading property, it no longer has
      that property.</p>

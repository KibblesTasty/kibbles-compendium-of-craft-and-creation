  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You infuse a ranged weapon with special, arcane magic. The weapon no
      longer requires ammunition to fire, as it creates magical ammunition when
      you fire it, and whenever you hit a target with this magical ammunition,
      the attack deals force damage, instead of the weaponâ€™s normal damage type.
      Additionally, if the weapon had the loading property, it no longer has
      that property.</p>

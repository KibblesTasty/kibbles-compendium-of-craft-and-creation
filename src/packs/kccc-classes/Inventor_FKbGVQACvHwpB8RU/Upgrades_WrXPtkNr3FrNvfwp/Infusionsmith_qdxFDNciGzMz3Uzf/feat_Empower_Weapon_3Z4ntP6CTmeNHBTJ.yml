      <p>When you hit a creature with a weapon, you can use your bonus action to
      infuse your strike with arcane energy, dealing an extra 2d6 force damage
      to the target. When you use this bonus action, you can also choose to
      expend a spell slot of 1st level or higher to further increase this extra
      damage. When you do so, the target takes an extra 1d6 force damage, plus
      another 1d6 per level of the spell slot.</p>

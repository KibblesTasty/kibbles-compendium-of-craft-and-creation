      <p><em>(Prerequisite: Perfection of Technique)</em></p>

      <p>Rather than cast out the Flaying Hook, you master the art of spinning
      your attached martial weapon by the chain in a windmill of death. Your
      weapon gains the Reach property when used in this way.</p>

      <p>Additionally, instead of attacking a target with it normally, as an
      action, you can spin the weapon wildly in giant deadly sweeps. Up to four
      creatures within 10 feet must make a Dexterity saving throw against a DC
      of 8 + your Strength modifier + your proficiency bonus. On failure they
      take damage equal to your weapon’s damage dice + your Strength modifier of
      your weapon’s damage type.</p>

      <p>If you have the Spiked Chain upgrade and hit one or more targets, you
      can select one of them to be affected by the special property of Spiked
      Chain.</p>

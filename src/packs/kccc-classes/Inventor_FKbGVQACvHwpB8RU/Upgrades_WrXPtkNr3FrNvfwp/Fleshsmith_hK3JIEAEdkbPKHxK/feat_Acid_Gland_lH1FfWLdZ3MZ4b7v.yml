  description:
    value: "<p>Realizing that putting something that oozes acid inside yourself could not possibly go wrong, you do just that. As an action, or as an attack as part of the Attack action, you can spew acid, making a ranged spell attack against a target within 30 feet. On a hit, you deal 3d8 acid damage.\_</p>\n<p>Alternatively, as an action, or as an attack as part of the Attack action, you can spray all creatures in a 30-foot cone. Each creature in the area must make a Dexterity saving throw against your spell save DC, taking 3d4 acid damage on failed save.\_</p>\n<p>Once you use either option, you can’t use this upgrade again until you finish a short or long rest. The damage increases by one die at 5th level (4d8 or 4d4), 11th level (5d8 or 5d4), and 17th level (6d8 or 6d4).</p>"

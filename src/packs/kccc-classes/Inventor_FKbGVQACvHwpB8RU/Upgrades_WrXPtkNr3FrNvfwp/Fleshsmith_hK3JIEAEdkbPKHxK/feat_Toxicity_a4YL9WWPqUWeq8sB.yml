  description:
    value: >-
      <p>Copying certain frog species, you make your blood poisonous. Once per
      turn, when a creature deals piercing or slashing damage to you while
      within 5 feet of you, they take poison damage equal to your Constitution
      modifier. If damage is from a biting attack, they take twice as much
      damage.</p>

      <p>You may also opt to make yourself take on a different skin hue, to let
      creatures know they shouldnâ€™t eat you.</p>

      <p><strong>Qualified Mutations: </strong>Extra Arm, Extra Tentacle</p>

      <p><strong>Effect:</strong> You gain an additional reaction you can only
      use to make an opportunity attack with that Fleshcrafted Mutation.</p>

      <p><strong>Empowered Effect:</strong> You can make an additional single
      attack with your Fleshcrafted addition. This attack only deals the weapon
      damage of the attack, and doesnâ€™t add your modifier to the damage
      dealt.</p>

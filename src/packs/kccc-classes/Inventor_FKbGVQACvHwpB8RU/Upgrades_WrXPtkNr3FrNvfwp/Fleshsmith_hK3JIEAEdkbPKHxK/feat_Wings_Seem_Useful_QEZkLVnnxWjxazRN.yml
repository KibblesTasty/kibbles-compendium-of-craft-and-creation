    value: >-
      <p>You decide that wings seem useful, and install a pair on your back. You
      can shape them like any naturally functional wings, such as a bird, bat,
      or insect. These grant you a flying speed equal to your walking speed, so
      long as you are not wearing heavy armor.</p>

    value: >-
      <p>Why should dragons have all the fun? You can now exhale fire. As an
      action, or as an attack as part of the Attack action, you can exhale a
      gout of flames in a 30-foot line or 15-foot cone. Creatures in the area
      must make a Dexterity saving throw against your spell save DC, or take 3d6
      fire damage. You can expend a spell slot to empower this fire breath,
      dealing a number of additional d6 equal to the level of the spell slot
      spent.</p>

      <p>Once you use the option, you canâ€™t use it again until you finish a
      short or long rest. The damage increases by 1d6 at 5th level (4d6) and
      again at 11th level (5d6), and 17th level (6d6).</p>

  description:
    value: "<p>As an action, you activate a booster allowing you move up to 40 feet in a straight line. During this movement, you can make a Strength (Athletics) check to grapple any creature you would collide with (you still require a free hand to grapple a creature as normal; if you do not have a free hand, the check automatically fails and you collide with the target). On success, you do not stop and it is carried with you for the remaining distance or until your movement is stopped by a creature or wall.</p>\n<p>At the end of the movement, any creature you collided with or are grappling takes 1d6 bludgeoning damage for each 5 feet you traveled. If your movement is stopped by a wall, and creature you are grappling must make Constitution saving throw. On failure, they are stunned until the end of their next turn.</p>\n<p>Once activated, it canâ€™t be used again until you finish a short\_ or long rest.</p>"

      <p>You learn to create a potent serum. As a bonus action, you can consume
      a dose of this serum, increasing your Strength and Dexterity modifiers by
      an amount equal to your Intelligence modifier (up to a maximum of +5) for
      a number of rounds equal to your Constitution modifier (minimum of 1),
      after which all effects of the serum fade at the start of your next turn.
      While you are under the effect of this serum, you also gain the benefits
      of the heroism spell. When these effects end, your speed is halved and you
      canâ€™t benefit from your Adrenaline Serum again until the start of your
      next turn.</p>

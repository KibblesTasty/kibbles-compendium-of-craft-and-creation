      <p>You experiment on creating an adorable critter. You create—or modify—a
      Tiny CR 0 creature. This creature serves as a familiar as per the find
      familiar spell, but doesn’t disappear when reduced to zero hit points, and
      simply becomes unconscious. It can’t fully die unless destroyed. If it
      starts its turn unconscious, it regains its full hit points and regains
      consciousness. It can do this a number of times equal to your Intelligence
      modifier.</p>

      <p>You can resuscitate it (or rebuild it, as necessary) at the end of a
      short or long rest should anything untoward happen to it without expending
      a spell slot or material component. Its creature type is construct.</p>

    value: >-
      <p>You can create a weapon with Projected Weapon as part of making an
      attack with it using Telekinetic Weapons, allowing you to project as many
      weapons in this manner as you make attacks (no additional action
      required). When you use weapons created by Projected Weaponry as the
      projectiles for your Telekinetic Weapons, the range you can fling the
      weapons is doubled.</p><p>Additionally, if you can expend 6 psi points to
      cast blade barrier generating a much larger number of ethereal blades as
      part of the casting.</p>

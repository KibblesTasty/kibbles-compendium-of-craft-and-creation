    value: >-
      <p>You infuse a magical item with your magic, creating a wondrous item.
      This item is an imperfect creation powered by your own magical power
      rather than a magical essence, and loses its magical power if you lose
      this upgrade. You can reclaim your power from the item by switching out
      this upgrade, or in a process taking 8 hours (after which you can infuse a
      new item). You can create a non-consumable wondrous item of Common or
      Uncommon rarity that is worth 500 gp or less.</p>

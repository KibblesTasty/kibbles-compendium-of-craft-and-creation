      <p>You concentrate and peer into the stream of future possibilities,
      gaining insight into what will happen next; you can select one of the
      following:</p>

      <p>You can grant advantage to yourself or to a creature that can see or
      hear you on their next attack roll made before the start of your next
      turn; if an attack that gained advantage from this feature hits, it deals
      an extra [[/r 1d6]] damage.</p>

      <p>You can grant disadvantage on the next attack roll against yourself or
      a creature that can see or hear you before the start of your next turn; if
      that attack hits despite the disadvantage, the damaged creature rolls [[/r
      1d6]] and subtracts that from the damage dealt.</p>

      <p>You can spend psi points up to your per use limit to add the following
      modifiers to Seeing (you can add multiple modifiers).</p>

      <p><strong>Omniscient (1 psi point):</strong> The beneficiary of your
      Seeing is under the effect of bless and guidance until the start of your
      next turn.</p>

      <p><strong>Piercing (1+ psi points):</strong> You see through the targetâ€™s
      defenses when granting advantage, increasing the damage of the attack
      benefiting from advantage by 1d8 per psi point spent if it hits.</p>

      <p><strong>Positioning (1+ psi points):</strong> The beneficiary of your
      Seeing can immediately move 5 feet per psi point spent (up to their speed)
      without provoking opportunity attacks.</p>

      <p><strong>Thwarting (2 psi points):</strong> The beneficiary of your
      Seeing has advantage on the next saving throw they make before the start
      of your next turn.</p>

      <p><strong>Withheld (0 psi points):</strong> Rather than granting
      advantage or disadvantage on the next attack, you can grant advantage or
      disavantage as a reaction to an attack being made until the start of your
      next turn.</p>

      <p>At 3rd level, you have a Spell Manual containing two 1st-level wizard
      spells of your choice. Your Spell Manual is a repository of any
      non-inventor spell you know.</p>

      <p>You can’t cast spells from your Spell Manual, and they don’t count
      against your number of spells known, but whenever you would learn a new
      inventor spell, you can select a spell from your Spell Manual instead of
      the inventor spell list. That spell then becomes an inventor spell for
      you, and you can cast it as normal. You can choose to scribe any inventor
      spell you know into your Spell Manual, as if copying it from a written
      spell.</p>

      <p>Learning Spells of 1st Level and Higher. Each time you gain an inventor
      level, you can add one wizard spell of your choice to your Spell Manual
      for free. The chosen spell must be of a level for which you have spell
      slots, as shown on the Inventor table.</p>

      <p>On your adventures, you might find other spells that you can add to
      your Spell Manual. For each level of the spell, the process takes 2 hours
      and costs 50 gp.</p>

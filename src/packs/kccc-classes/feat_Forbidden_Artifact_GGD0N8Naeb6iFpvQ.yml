      <p>At 1st level, you set yourself apart from other Inventors by seizing
      power that others dare not wield. You partake in a dark ritual investing
      enormous power and a part of your soul into a weapon. The weapon becomes
      permanently bound to you. You have proficiency with the weapon. If the
      weapon is lost or destroyed, you can reform it by drawing on its
      connection to your soul. This is a special ritual that takes 1 day, and
      summons the weapon to you if it was lost, or recreates it if it was
      destroyed.</p>

      <p>When you perform the rite, select two of the following upgrades:
      Empowered Artifact, Abhorrent Life, Grasping Form, Twisting Reach,
      Necrotic Wounding, or Eldritch Eruption. You can select additional
      properties as Upgrades, but your Forbidden Artifact can have a maximum
      number of these Upgrades equal to your proficiency bonus (meaning the
      first time you can select an additional property is 5th level).</p>

    value: >-
      <p>You gain the ability to add Telepathic Intrusion modifiers to Mind
      Leech.</p><p>Additionally, when you deal psychic damage to a creature that
      is frightened of you, you can render yourself invisible to that creature
      until the start of your next turn; you can immediately (no action
      required) roll an Intelligence (Stealth) check affecting only creatures
      you are invisible from as a result of this talent.</p><p>If you are hidden
      from a creature that is frightened of you, when it moves, you can use your
      reaction to teleport to an unoccupied space within 5 feet of that creature
      (at the completion of their movement).</p>

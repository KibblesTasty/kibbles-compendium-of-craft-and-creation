  description:
    value: >-
      <p>Starting at 3rd level, when you use Telepathic Intrusion, you can force
      the target to make an Intelligence saving throw instead of a Wisdom saving
      throw against the power (deciding when you use the ability).</p>

      <p>When a creature fails a saving throw against your Telepathic Intrusion,
      you gain a d4. Until the end of your next turn, if you make an attack roll
      against the creature or the creature makes a saving throw against one of
      your psionic powers other than Telepathic Intrusion, you can add or
      subtract the d4 from the roll (deciding to roll before you roll the attack
      or use the power).</p>

      <p>Additionally, starting at 1st level, you can use Intelligence instead
      of Wisdom when making an Insight check against a creature with an
      Intelligence ability score of 6 or higher.</p>

      creature, you know their general location (direction and rough estimate of
      distance) for the next hour as long as you are on the same plane as
      them.</p>

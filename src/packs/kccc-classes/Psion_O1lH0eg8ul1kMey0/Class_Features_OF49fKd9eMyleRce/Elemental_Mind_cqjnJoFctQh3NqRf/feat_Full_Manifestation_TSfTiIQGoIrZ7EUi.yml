  description:
    value: >-
      <p>Starting at 10th level, when you enter a primordial aspect, you can
      expend 1 psi point to fully manifest that element, replacing the
      primordial aspect with the following effect. If you are specialized in
      that element, it doesn’t require a psi point to fully manifest the
      power.</p>

      <ul>

      <li>Cold: Your speed becomes 0 until the end of your next turn, but you
      have resistance to all damage types except fire and force.</li>

      <li>Fire: Fire fills a 10-foot radius around you. When a creature enters
      the area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it takes
      fire damage equal to 1d4 + your proficiency bonus.</li>

      <li>Lightning: You can use your movement to teleport a distance up to your
      speed for the duration.</li>

      </ul>

      <p>If you are not in a primordial aspect, you can fully manifest a power
      as a bonus action for 2 psi points (or 1 psi point if you are specialized
      in that power).</p>

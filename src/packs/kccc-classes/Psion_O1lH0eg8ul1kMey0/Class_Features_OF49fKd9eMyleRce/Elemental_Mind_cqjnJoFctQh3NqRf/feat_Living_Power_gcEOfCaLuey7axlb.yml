      <p>Starting at 3rd level, your powers become a living extension of your
      mind, weaving an extension of your will into reality. Overcharging an
      Elmenetal Blast deals 1 force damage to you (instead of 1d4 force damage)
      and you can manipulate your powers in more advanced ways. When you use a
      power or alternate effect of Psychokinetics, you can apply one of the
      following modifiers:</p>

      <h2>Shaped Power</h2>

      <p>When you use a power or spell that makes a ranged spell attack, you can
      convert it to a melee spell attack (such as forming it into a weapon
      shape), and when you would make an attack that would make a melee spell
      attack, you can instead form it into a shape and hurl it at a target
      within 15 feet making a ranged spell attack.</p>

      <h2>Controlled Power</h2>

      <p>When you use a spell or power that targets an area, you can select a
      number of creatures equal to the psi points spent in the area of effect
      for the spell or power to be ignored. The power passes harmlessly around
      these creatures, they automatically succeed on their saving throw against
      the effect, and they take no damage if they would normally take half
      damage on a successful save against the effect.</p>

      <h2>Raging Power</h2>

      <p>When you use a spell or power, you can let it rage out of control. When
      you roll damage for the power or spell, you can reroll a number of dice up
      to 1 + the number of psi points spent. You must use the new roll.</p>

    value: >-
      <p>Starting at 3rd level, you gain the Psionic Talent Mind Devourer; this
      talent ignores the normal level restriction, and doesn’t count against
      your Psionic Talents known, but can’t be switched out on leveling up.</p>

      <p>Additionally, you can gain the benefit of this Talent from a range of
      30 feet when the creature is killed by one of your psionic powers.</p>

    value: >-
      <p>Additionally at 1st level, your powers grant you intuition that allows
      you to better adapt and survive as a mind hunter. You gain proficiency in
      Stealth and Deception. If you are already proficient in either skill, you
      instead become proficient in a skill of your choice.</p>

      <p>When you use psionic abilities, you can make an Intelligence
      (Deception) check contested by a target’s Wisdom (Insight) to conceal your
      use of psionic powers from them, suppressing the ability’s usual visible
      indicators. If you spend psi points on the ability, you must subtract the
      psi points spent from your Intelligence (Deception) roll result
      (concealing greater uses of psionics being more difficult).</p>

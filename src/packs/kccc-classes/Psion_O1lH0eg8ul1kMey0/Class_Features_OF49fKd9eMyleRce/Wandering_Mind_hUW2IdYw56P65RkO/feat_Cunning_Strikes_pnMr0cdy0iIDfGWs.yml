      <p>Starting at 3rd level, you gain the Rift Strike talent. If you already
      have the Rift Strike talent, you can gain one other Psionic Talent of your
      choice. The Rift Strike talent doesn’t count against your Psionic Talents
      known, but can’t be switched out on leveling up.</p>

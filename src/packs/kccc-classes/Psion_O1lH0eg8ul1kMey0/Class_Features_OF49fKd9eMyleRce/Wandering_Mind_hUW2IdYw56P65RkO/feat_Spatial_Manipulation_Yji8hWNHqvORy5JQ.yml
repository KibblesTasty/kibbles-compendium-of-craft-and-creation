  description:
    value: "<p>At 1st level when you select this archetype, your mind\_grows a greater perspective on the nature of space\_and dimensions, allowing you to manipulate it and your relation to it, granting you the psionic discipline\_of Transposition.\_</p>\n<p>Additionally, your connection to your transdimensional powers are such that you can slide through the spaces you see in dimensions as another might slip through a tight space, without conscious thought or effort. You can use your Dexterity ability score in place of your Intelligence ability score calculating the DC or attack roll modifier of Transpositional powers, alternate effects, or talents that require the Transpositional discipline.</p>"

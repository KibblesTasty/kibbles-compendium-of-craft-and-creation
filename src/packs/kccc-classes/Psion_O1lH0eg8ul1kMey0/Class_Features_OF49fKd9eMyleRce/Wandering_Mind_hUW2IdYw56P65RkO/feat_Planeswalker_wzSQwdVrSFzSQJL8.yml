      <p>Starting at 14th level, your understanding of how to traverse space
      expands to a previously incomprehensible scale. You gain the ability to
      cast plane shift and teleport. You can cast one of these spells per day
      once without expending a spell slot or use of Innate Psionics. Once you do
      this, you must finish a long rest before you can use them again, or use
      your 7th level or higher use of Innate Psionics instead of the spell
      selected for that level to cast these spells again before finishing a long
      rest. If you already have one of these spells selected for your 7th level
      Innate psionic power, you can select a new 7th-level spell from the psion
      list for that slot. Material components are still required for casting
      plane shift this way.</p>

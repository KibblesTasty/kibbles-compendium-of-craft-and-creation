      <p>Starting at 3rd level, your wandering mind adapts to new situations
      constantly. Whenever you finish a long rest, you can select two skills you
      lack proficiency in. Until the end of your next long rest, you can add
      half your proficiency bonus, rounded down, to ability checks made with
      those skills.</p>

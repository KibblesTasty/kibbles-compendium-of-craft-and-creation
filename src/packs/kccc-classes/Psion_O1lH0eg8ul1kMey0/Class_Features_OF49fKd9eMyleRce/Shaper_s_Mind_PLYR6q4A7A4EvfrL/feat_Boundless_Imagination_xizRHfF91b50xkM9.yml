    value: >-
      <p>Additionally at 1st level, when you conjure your Astral Construct, you
      can apply one of the following powers to it:</p>

      <ul>

      <li><strong>Devastating Weapons. </strong>You imagine more deadly
      armaments—from a greatsword to vicious fangs—causing your Astral Construct
      to grow more deadly. The Astral Construct’s damage becomes 1d12</li>

      <li><strong>Psionic Conduit. </strong>You can use your psionic powers,
      spells, talents through your Astral Construct, as if you were in its
      space.</li>

      <li><strong>Vivid Existence.</strong> Your Astral Construct fully
      materializes and automatically uses Solidify at the start of your turn
      without requiring a command to do so.</li>

      </ul>

      <p>You can change which benefit you grant it for the duration of the
      effect as a bonus action.</p>

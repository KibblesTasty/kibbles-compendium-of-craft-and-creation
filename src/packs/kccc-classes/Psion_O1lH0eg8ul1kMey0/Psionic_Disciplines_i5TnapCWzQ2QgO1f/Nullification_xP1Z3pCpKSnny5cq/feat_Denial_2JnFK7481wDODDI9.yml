      <p>You release a burst of raw psionic nullification at a creature you can
      see within range. The creature must make a Charisma saving throw. On
      failure, it takes [[/damage 1d4 force]] damage as its existence is
      disrupted.</p><p>If the target is an aberration, celestial, construct,
      elemental, fey, fiend, undead, or a creature with the ability to cast
      spells or use psionic powers, it takes an extra [[/damage 1d4 force]]
      damage, and becomes disoriented; until the end of its next turn, it rolls
      a d4 and subtracts the number rolled from all its attack rolls and ability
      checks, as well as its Constitution saving throws to maintain
      concentration. A creature can choose to fail the saving throw.</p><p>You
      can spend psi points up to your per use limit to add the following
      modifiers to Denial modifying its functionality (you can add multiple
      modifiers). The points must be spent when choosing the target of the
      power.</p><p><strong>Aura of (3 psi points):</strong> Instead of targeting
      a creature, the power becomes an effect around you with a radius of 20
      feet until the start of your next turn; any creature of your choice that
      enters or starts its turn in the area of effect must make a saving throw
      against the power.</p><p><strong>Existential (1+ psi points):</strong> You
      deal an additional 1d4 initial and bonus (if applicable) force damage to
      the target creature on a failed save.</p><p><strong>Firm (2 psi points):
      </strong>The target creature has disadvantage on the saving throw against
      this ability.</p><p><strong>Lingering (1+ psi points):</strong> You can
      apply the effect of Disruptive Touch to an affected
      creature.</p><p><strong>Supernatural (1+ psi points):</strong> A
      supernatural effect of or on the creature is ended; if the effect is a
      magical or psionic power, it is only ended if the psi points spent on this
      modifier equals or exceeds the spell level or psi points spent on the
      effect.</p><p>If the property is an innate property of a creature (either
      of the target creature, or affecting the target of this power), it is only
      ended if the psi points exceed the CR (or class levels) of the target
      creature, and they return at the end of that creature’s next turn. The
      supernatural effect can’t be its existence, unless it has less than 10 hit
      points and it would otherwise qualify.</p>

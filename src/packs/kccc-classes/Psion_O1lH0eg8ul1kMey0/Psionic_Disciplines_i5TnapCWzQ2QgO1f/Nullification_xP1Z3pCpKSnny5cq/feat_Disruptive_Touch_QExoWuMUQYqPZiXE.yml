      <p>When you gain this feature, you can create an aura of interference,
      wreathing yourself in the disruptive power that asserts reality. You can
      end minor magical or psionic effects (such as the result of cantrips or
      zero point psionic powers) by touching them, and have resistance to
      illusions or magical damage from things you touch (gaining advantage on
      the saving throw against them, if applicable).</p>

      <p>If you are grappling or otherwise touching a spellcasting or psionic
      creature, at the start of your turn you can expend 1 or more psi to
      interfere with their abilities until the start of your next turn. In order
      to cast a spell or use a psionic power, they must succeed on a saving
      throw of their spellcasting or psionic ability score against your psionics
      DC, unless they are casting a spell with a higher level or using a power
      with more psi points than the psi points spent on this feature.</p>

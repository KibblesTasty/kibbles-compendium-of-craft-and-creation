  description:
    value: >-
      <p>While you have a psionic charge, as an action you can invest it into a
      corpse, bringing it to a state of unlife, becoming a zombie or skeleton
      under your control. It acts on its own initiative immediately after your
      turn. Its unlife fades at the end of your next turn unless you expend a
      psionic charge or psi point on your next turn (no action required) to
      continue its animation for an additional round. You can spend Psionic
      Mastery points on this.</p>

      <p>You can psionically link yourself to other creatures. As a reaction to
      a creature you can see within 120 feet of you taking damage, you can grant
      them resistance to the damage taken, but you take psychic damage equal to
      the damage they take (after resistance). The damage you take canâ€™t be
      reduced or prevented in any way.</p>

      <p>If the damage would inflict any further negative status effect on the
      target, you can choose for that effect to affect you instead.</p>

      <p>If you have any form of telepathic bond that allows long-distance
      telepathic communication affecting the creature taking this damage, the
      range is unlimited and you do not need to be able to see them.</p>

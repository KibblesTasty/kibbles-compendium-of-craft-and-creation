  description:
    value: >-
      <p>Your Telepathic Communication gains an unlimited range as long as you
      have communicated with the creature within the last day, and the target
      willingly maintains the link. However, it takes an action to focus to
      communicate over distance if you can’t see the target (or for the target
      to communicate with you if they can’t see you). You can maintain a link
      with a number of people equal to your Intelligence modifier in this way.
      You can convey as much in a turn as you could by speaking normally.</p>

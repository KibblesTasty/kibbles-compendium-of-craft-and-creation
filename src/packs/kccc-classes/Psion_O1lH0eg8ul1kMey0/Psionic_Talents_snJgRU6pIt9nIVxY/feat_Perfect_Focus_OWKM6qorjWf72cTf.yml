  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You can enter a state of extreme focus. Your concentration is no longer
      interrupted by using a second ability that requires concentration, but
      your speed is reduced to 0 while concentrating on more than one effect;
      you have a −5 penalty to any Constitution saving throw to maintain
      concentration. If you move or fail a save to maintain concentration, one
      of the spells you are concentrating on ends. If you fail the saving throw
      to maintain concentration by 5 or more, you lose concentration on both
      spells.</p>

      <p>You can spend 1 psi point to temporarily divide your mind to do two
      things at once until the end of your turn. While dividing your mind, if
      you use your action on a psionic power or spell granted by a Psionic
      Discipline, you can use your bonus action to use a psionic power that
      would normally take an action. The two powers share your per use psi point
      limit between them.</p>

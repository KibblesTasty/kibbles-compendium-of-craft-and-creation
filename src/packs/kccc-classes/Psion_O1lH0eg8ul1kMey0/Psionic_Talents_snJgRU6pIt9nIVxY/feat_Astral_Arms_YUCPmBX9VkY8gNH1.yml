      <p>As a bonus action, you can expend 1 psi point to create psionic
      constructions serving as additional appendages. These arms last for 10
      minutes. You determine the arms’ appearance, and they vanish early if you
      are incapacitated or die. You can use the astral arms to make unarmed
      strikes. The unarmed strikes you make with the arms use your Intelligence
      modifier in place of your Strength modifier for the attack and damage
      rolls. If you hit with one of them, you deal force damage equal to 1d6 +
      your Intelligence modifier, instead of the bludgeoning damage normal for
      an unarmed strike.</p>

      <p>When you create them, or by spending 1 psi point as a bonus action
      while they are manifested, you can make a single unarmed strike with these
      arms as a bonus action. You can use Psionic Mastery points on this.</p>

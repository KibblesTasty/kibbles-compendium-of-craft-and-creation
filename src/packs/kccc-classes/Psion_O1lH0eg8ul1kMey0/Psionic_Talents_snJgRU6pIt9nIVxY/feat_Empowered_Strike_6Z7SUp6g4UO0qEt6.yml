    value: >-
      <p>Once per turn, as part of making a weapon attack as part of the Attack
      action, you can empower a melee weapon you are holding with psionic power.
      When you hit a creature with a weapon, you can apply Elemental Blast or
      Telekinetic Force modifiers (you can only select a power you know) to the
      attack (you can use Psionic Mastery on this). This doesn’t deal the base
      damage of the power, but any added damage causes the additional effects of
      the power to occur.</p><p>When applying a modifier that would make it
      target an area of effect, only the target takes the weapon damage, but
      other creatures in the radius become a target of the attack as if using
      the power normally.</p>

    value: >-
      <p>Once per turn, as part of making a weapon attack as part of the Attack
      action, you can empower a melee weapon you are holding with psionic power.
      When you hit a creature with a weapon, you can apply Elemental Blast or
      Telekinetic Force modifiers (you can only select a power you know) to the
      attack (you can use Psionic Mastery on this). This doesnâ€™t deal the base
      damage of the power, but any added damage causes the additional effects of
      the power to occur.</p><p>When applying a modifier that would make it
      target an area of effect, only the target takes the weapon damage, but
      other creatures in the radius become a target of the attack as if using
      the power normally.</p>

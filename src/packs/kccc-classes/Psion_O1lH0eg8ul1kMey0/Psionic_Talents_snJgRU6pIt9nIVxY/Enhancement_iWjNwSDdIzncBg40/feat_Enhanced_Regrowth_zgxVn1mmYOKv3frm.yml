      <p>You gain the @Compendium[dnd5e.spells.uUWb1wZgtMou0TVP]{Cure Wounds}
      spell, and can cast it as a 1st-level spell by expending 1 psi point. You
      can cast it at a higher level by spending an additional psi point for each
      level above first. When you cast cure wounds on a creature, you can use
      Enhancing Surge on that creature as a bonus action.</p>

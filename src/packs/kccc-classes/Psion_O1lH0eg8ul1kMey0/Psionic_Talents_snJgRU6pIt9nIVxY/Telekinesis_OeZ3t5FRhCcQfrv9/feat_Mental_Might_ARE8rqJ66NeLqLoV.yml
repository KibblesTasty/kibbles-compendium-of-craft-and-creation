  description:
    value: "<p>You learn to focus your mental grip. You can use your Intelligence modifier instead of other ability modifiers when you make an Athletics check.\_</p>\n<p>Additionally, you may attempt to grapple or shove a creature within 30 feet, using your mind. When grappling a creature in this way, you canâ€™t move them. Maintaining a grapple at a range greater than your natural reach requires concentration, as if concentrating on a spell, and the grapple ends if concentration is lost.</p>"

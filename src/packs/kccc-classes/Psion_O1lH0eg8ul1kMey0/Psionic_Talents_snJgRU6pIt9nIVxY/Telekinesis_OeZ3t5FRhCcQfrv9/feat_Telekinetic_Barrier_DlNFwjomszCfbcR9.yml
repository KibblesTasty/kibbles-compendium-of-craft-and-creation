  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You focus your telekinetic power, spreading it thin to create a large
      barrier. As an action you can expend 2 psi points to create a wall of weak
      telekinetic force 15 feet high and up to 40 feet long, or as a 15 radius
      around you. This barrier is visible as small objects hover and float
      within it. If you create it around yourself, it moves with you when you
      move. Ranged attacks that pass through this barrier are made with
      disadvantage as their trajectory is deflected. You can maintain this
      barrier by concentrating, as if concentrating on a spell, for up to 1
      minute after creating it.</p>

      <p>When you are subjected to a saving throw, you can expend 1 psi point
      and glimpse into the future. You know what the effect you are saving
      against is if it is a spell or psionic effect as if you passed an
      Intelligence (Arcana) or Intelligence (Psionics) check to identify it.
      Additionally you can add your Intelligence modifier to your saving throw
      against it regardless of its nature.</p>

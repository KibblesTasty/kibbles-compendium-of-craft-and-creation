      <p>When you finish a long rest, your dreams have prepared you for the day
      to come. Upon waking, you issue reassuring words and advice to your
      companions to help them survive the day, giving them temporary hit points
      equal to your Intelligence modifier. During the next 24 hours, you can’t
      be surprised.</p>

    value: >-
      <p>As an action, you can produce an instant reaction, throwing this
      combination of reagents at a point within 20 feet of you, which causes a
      caustic acid to splatter the area within a 5-foot-radius sphere centered
      on that point. Each creature in that area must succeed on a Dexterity
      saving throw against your spell save DC or take 2d4 acid damage. Damage
      from this acid deals double damage to objects and structures.</p>

      <p>The damage increases by 2d4 when you reach 5th level (4d4), 11th level
      (6d4), and 17th level (8d4).</p>

      <p>Alternatively, you can use a bonus action to prepare this instant
      reaction as a ranged weapon with which you are proficient. It lasts until
      the end of your turn, and it has the finesse and thrown (20/60)
      properties. On a hit, it deals damage equal to failing the saving throw
      against this effect. The damage dealt by this attack doesnâ€™t include your
      Strength or Dexterity modifier.</p>

  description:
    value: "<p>You delve into the darkest, most mysterious depths of herbal lore, learning the potent secrets of poison. You gain profi-ciency with poisoner’s kits; if you already have this proficiency, your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make using a poisoner’s kit. Additionally, during a long rest, you can create one of the following poisons of your choice:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Contact Poison.</strong> You can apply this poison to a melee weapon or up to ten pieces of ammunition. That weapon or ammunition deals an extra 1d4 poison damage on a hit; the weapon can deal this poison damage 10 times before the poison wears off.</li>\n<li><strong>Ingested Poison.</strong> This poison is a simple, flavorless powder. If a creature consumes a full dose of the poison, it must make a Constitution saving throw with disadvantage against your spell save DC. After 1 minute, if the creature failed its saving throw, it takes 1d10 poison damage per level you have in this class, and it becomes poisoned until it finishes a long rest.\_</li>\n<li><strong>Inhaled Poison.</strong> You can use this dose of poison to increase the size and potency of your Poisonous Gas instant reaction. When you do so, the fumes erupt in a 20-foot-radius sphere and the effect’s damage dice are doubled.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Any unused poison loses its potency and no longer has any effect after you finish your next long rest.</p>"

    value: >-
      <p>You apply your animation magic to a shield. At the end of a long rest,
      you can touch a shield, causing it to spring to life and protect you until
      you finish your next long rest. While it is protecting you, you gain the
      benefits of the shield as if you were wielding it. As usual, you can
      benefit from only one shield at a time.</p>

      <p>While you have an animated shield, you can also send it to defend your
      allies. When a creature you can see attacks a target other than you that
      is within 30 feet of you, you can use your reaction to impose disadvantage
      on the attack roll. When you do so, you lose the benefits of the animated
      shield until the start of your next turn.</p>

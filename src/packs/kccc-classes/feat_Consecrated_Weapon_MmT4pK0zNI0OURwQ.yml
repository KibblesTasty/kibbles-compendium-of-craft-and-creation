      <p>You gain the ability to focus divine energy into a weapon. As a bonus
      action, you can touch a weapon, consecrating it. For 10 minutes, the
      weapon emits bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an
      additional 30 feet. It deals an extra 1d8 radiant damage on hit while
      under this effect. If the weapon houses your Divine Relic, the damage is
      instead increased by 2d8 radiant damage. While consecrated, the wielder of
      the weapon is under the effect of the spell protection from evil and
      good.</p><p> Once you use this ability, you canâ€™t use it again until you
      finish a long rest, unless you expend a 5th-level spell slot to, allowing
      you to use it again.</p>

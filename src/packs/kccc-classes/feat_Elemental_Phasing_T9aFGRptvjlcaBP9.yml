      <p>As you step between planes, you can tap into the Elemental Planes,
      bringing their power into the material with you. You can use Psychokinetic
      modifiers on Phase Rift (excluding Massive).</p><p> Additionally, whenever
      you deal damage to an area with a Psychokinetics ability that would
      include yourself, you can phase yourself out of reality to take no damage
      from the effect.</p>

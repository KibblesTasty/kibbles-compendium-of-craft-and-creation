  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You bind your soul to your golem. Your consciousness is transferred to
      the golem, and you gain complete control of the golem, retaining both its
      action and your own, but you are only able to take any action the golem
      could take with its action. </p><p>Your golem’s mental stats are replaced
      by your mental stats, and your golem gains all of your spell slots,
      attunement slots, and class features. Your former body dies and can’t be
      resurrected, unless a wish or similar magic returns your soul to your
      body</p>

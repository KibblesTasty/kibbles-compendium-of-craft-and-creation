      <p>You attain full mastery of your body and its functionality, able to
      detect when it malfunctions. As a reaction to failing a saving throw
      against becoming blinded, deafened, paralyzed, poisoned, or infected by a
      disease as the result of failing a Constitution saving throw, you can end
      the effect, even if you would normally not be able to take reactions due
      to the effect.</p>

      <p>Once you do this, you canâ€™t do this again until you finish a short or
      long rest.</p>

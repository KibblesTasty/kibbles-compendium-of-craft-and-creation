    value: "<p>When you project a weapon with your Project Item feature, it gains the following benefits:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You can project it as a bonus action and you can project up 3 weapons or pieces of ammunition at the same time.</li>\n<li>You are proficient with any projected weapon.</li>\n<li>It is no longer restricted to a maximum of 3 feet when it takes the form of a weapon (for a Medium-sized creature).</li>\n<li>You can use your Intelligence modifier in place of your Strength or Dexterity modifier for attack and damage rolls with it.</li>\n<li>If it has the thrown property, its throwing range is doubled. If it doesn’t have the thrown property, it gains the thrown (10/30) property.</li>\n<li>You can apply the Astral Construct modifiers Grow and Sustain to Projected Weaponry. Grow adds 1d8 to the weapon’s damage dice. You can expend Psionic Mastery on these modifiers.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\_</p>"

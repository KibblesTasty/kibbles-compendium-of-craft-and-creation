      <p>Also at 3rd level, you can use your Spell Manual to infuse magic items,
      such as wands, storing magical power for later use. Over the course of 1
      minute, you can perform a special ritual to cast a spell into the item,
      expending a spell slot as normal. The spell being stored has no immediate
      effect when cast in this way.</p>

      <p>Thereafter, a creature holding the item that is aware there is magic
      infused in it can trigger the stored magic, casting the spell. The
      creature must have an Intelligence of 6 or higher to cast the spell in
      this way.</p>

      <p>The spell uses your spell save DC, spell attack bonus, and spellcasting
      ability, but is in all other ways treated as if the crea-</p>

      <p>ture holding it cast the spell. The spell infused in the item fades if
      you finish a long rest and the stored magic hasnâ€™t been triggered</p>

    value: >-
      <p>You build in systems to maximize defensive potential. As a reaction to
      taking damage, you can brace your armor, locking it in a defensive
      position. Until the start of your next turn, you gain resistance to all
      damage (Including the triggering damage) and any subsequent attacks made
      against you are made with disadvantage. On your next turn after taking
      this action, your speed is halved and you canâ€™t take an action (you can
      still take a bonus action).</p>

    value: >-
      <p>When you use an Enhancing Surge to empower a creature, you can expend a
      psi point to augment it with your Telekinesis to further assist them,
      optionally granting one of the following benefits:</p><ul><li>You can move
      the creature 10 feet (this movement doesnâ€™t provoke opportunity
      attacks).</li><li>You can telekinetically deflect the first weapon attack
      against them before the start of your next turn, giving that attack
      disadvantage.</li><li>You can telekinetically boost their next Strength
      (Athletics) check or weapon attack before the start of your next turn,
      granting that check or attack advantage.</li></ul><p>Addititionally, while
      under the effect of Enhancing Surge, the amount you can lift, drag, or
      carry is doubled with assistance of your telekinesis, and you can apply
      Telekinetic Force modifiers to your weapon attacks.</p>

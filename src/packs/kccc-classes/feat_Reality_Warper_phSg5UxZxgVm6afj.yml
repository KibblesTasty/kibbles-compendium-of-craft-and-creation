    value: >-
      <p>You can bring the illusions you make people see to life. When you are
      concentrating on an illusion spell, as a bonus action you can expend psi
      points during your turn to bring aspects of the illusion into reality. For
      each psi point spent you can bring a 5-foot-cube section of the illusion
      into reality until the start of your next turn, and it can have the
      following effects:</p><ul><li>If the effect would do damage, each 5-foot
      cube can damage one target. That target must pass a Dexterity saving
      throw, or take damage equal to a number of d8 dice equal to the level of
      the spell.</li><li>If the effect would stop a creature, they canâ€™t move
      through it. If the effect would restrain a creature, that creature must
      pass a Dexterity saving throw or become restrained until the start of your
      next turn.</li><li>Each 5-foot cube can affect only one creature that is
      either within it or adjacent to it. The GM may allow other effects at
      their discretion.</li></ul>

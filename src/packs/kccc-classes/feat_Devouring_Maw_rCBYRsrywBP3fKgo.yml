    value: >-
      <p>Due to the inefficiency of having only one intake port, you build an
      additional one, properly equipped with razor sharp fangs and a special
      property. This maw becomes a natural weapon that deals 1d10 piercing
      damage.</p>

      <p>If you hit with an attack with this maw, you can choose to make a
      grapple against the target as a bonus action. Targets grappled by this maw
      take 1d4 piercing and 1d4 acid damage at the start of their turn.</p>

      <p>Attacks with this maw are made with advantage against targets it is
      grappling, but it canâ€™t be used to attack other creatures while grappling
      a creature.</p>

      <p>If you have the Fleshcrafted Enhancement upgrade, you can apply a
      benefit from it to this Maw. This can be a different selection than the
      one applied to your Fleshcrafted Mutation.</p>

    value: >-
      <p>Starting at 10th level, when you would take damage while you have an
      Astral Construct within 30 feet of you, you can use your reaction to
      conjure it to you (sharing your space) and expend 1 psi point to Solidify
      it, transposing it between you and the source of damage. It takes the
      damage instead of you. If the attack deals more damage than it has hit
      points (from Solidify), you take the remainder of the damage.</p>

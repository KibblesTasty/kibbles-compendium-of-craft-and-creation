    value: >-
      <p>When you cast a concentration spell, you can mark a rune that maintains
      concentration on the spell. The rune be can marked on a willing creature,
      or into the air (in which case it can’t move). The rune can be targeted
      and has an AC of 10 and 10 hit points, with resistance to nonmagical
      damage. It lasts for the duration of the spell unless destroyed. You can
      only have one Living Rune marked at a time.</p>

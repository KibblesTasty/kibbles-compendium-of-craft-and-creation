      <p>You can select an upgrade that applies to your Cross-Disciplinary
      Knowledge selection. This can be an upgrade that directly improves it, or
      that requires it, of 5th level or lower. An upgrade selected in this way
      that does not normally have a limit (such as selecting Healing Draught or
      Frostbloom Reaction) can be used a maximum number of times equal to your
      proficiency bonus.</p><p>Alternatively, you can directly upgrade the
      benefit gained from your Cross-Disciplinary Upgrade, giving it a +1 to its
      attack rolls or save DC (up to a maximum total bonus of +3).</p>

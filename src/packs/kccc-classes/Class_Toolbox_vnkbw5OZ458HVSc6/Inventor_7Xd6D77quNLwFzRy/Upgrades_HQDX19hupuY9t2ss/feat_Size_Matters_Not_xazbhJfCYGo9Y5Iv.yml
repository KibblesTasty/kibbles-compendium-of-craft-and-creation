      <p>When you animate a weapon, you can animate the weapon of a Large-sized
      creature. You can only animate one Large-sized weapon at a time. This
      weapon deals twice the damage dice of a weapon for a Medium-sized
      creature. The weapon is always considered to have the heavy property,
      regardless of weapon type.</p>

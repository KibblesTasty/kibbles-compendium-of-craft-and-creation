      <p>You learn the spell
      @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.ATo0Eb63TDtnu6iA]{animate objects}. It
      does not count against your spells known, and if you already know animate
      objects, you can learn a new spell of 5th level or lower that does not
      count against your spells known. </p><p>When you cast animate objects, you
      can expend a Hit Die in addition to the spell slot. When you do so, the
      spell is invest with your soul, and no longer requires concentration. When
      cast in this way, it lasts until you cast animate objects again, or until
      all the animated objects are destroyed.</p>

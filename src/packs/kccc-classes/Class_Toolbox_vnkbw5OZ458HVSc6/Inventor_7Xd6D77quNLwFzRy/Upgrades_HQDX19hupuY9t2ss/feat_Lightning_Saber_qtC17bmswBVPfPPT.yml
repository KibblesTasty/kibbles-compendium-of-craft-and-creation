    value: >-
      <p>You generate enough energy with your charged blade to form the blade
      from pure scintillating lighting. Your weapon casts bright light in a
      color of your choice for 30 feet, and dim light for additional 30 feet.
      </p><p>If your target is wearing nonmagical armor or natural armor, your
      attacks treat their armor class as 10 + their Dexterity modifier; only
      magical effects can add additional AC to the targetâ€™s defenses.</p>

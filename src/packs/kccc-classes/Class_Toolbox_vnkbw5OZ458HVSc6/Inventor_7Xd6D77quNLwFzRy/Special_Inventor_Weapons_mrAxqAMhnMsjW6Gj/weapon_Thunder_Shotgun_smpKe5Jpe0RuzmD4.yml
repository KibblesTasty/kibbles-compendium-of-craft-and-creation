      <p>You use the power of thunder to launch a projectile with terrible
      power, if limited accuracy, over long distances. Ringing out with a
      booming crash, it brings fear to the battlefield.</p><p>A special cannon
      made to devastate at close range. This weapon has a range of 30/90, but
      doesnâ€™t suffer disadvantage when there is a creature within melee range of
      you. It deals [[/damage 4d4]] damage to targets within 10 feet, [[/damage
      3d4]] damage to targets within 20 feet, [[/damage 2d4]] damage to targets
      within 30 feet, and [[/damage 1d4]] damage to targets beyond 30 feet. This
      weapon has advantage on targets within 10 feet of you so long as there is
      nothing between you and the target.</p><p>This weapon must be reloaded
      with your bonus action once fired, and has disadvantage on all attacks if
      you have a Strength of 12 or less.</p>

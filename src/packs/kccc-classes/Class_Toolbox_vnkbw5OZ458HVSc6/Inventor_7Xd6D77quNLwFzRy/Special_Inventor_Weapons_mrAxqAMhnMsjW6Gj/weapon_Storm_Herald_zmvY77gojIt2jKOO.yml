      <p>You use the power of thunder to launch a projectile with terrible
      power, if limited accuracy, over long distances. Ringing out with a
      booming crash, it brings fear to the battlefield.</p><p>A massive,
      elegantly wrought cannon, it has many fine gears and sliding plates. In
      its compact mode, it functions as a Thunder Cannon. This weapon can add +1
      to its attack and damage rolls.</p><p>As an action, you can deploy it into
      its "Herald" configuration, greatly extending the length of the
      weapon.</p><p>While it is extended, the weapons range becomes 300/900 and
      your speed is halved, and any attack roll you make after moving on your
      turn is made with disadvantage. You can collapse it back to its compact
      mode as a bonus action.</p>

      <p>You devour all supernatural effects near you. Whenever a creature
      (including yourself) within 5 feet of you takes damage from a magical
      source, you can expend 1 or more psi points to use your reaction to reduce
      the damage taken by 1d8 per psi point spent. You can divide this amount
      between multiple creatures within range if they take damage at the same
      time. </p><p>Additionally, whenever you successfully cast counterspell,
      dispel magic, or remove curse, you regain hit points equal to the level of
      spell stopped or ended.</p>

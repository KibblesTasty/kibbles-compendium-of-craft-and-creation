  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You project an ethereal creation from your mind at a space you can see
      within range, taking the shape of a Medium or smaller creature, weapon, or
      other object. This creation is clearly ethereal in nature. When you create
      it, and on subsequent turns using your action to mentally control it, you
      can move it up to 30 feet in any direction and attack, so long as it
      doesn’t move beyond the range of the power. To attack with it, make a
      melee spell attack. On a hit, the target takes 1d8 force damage. If the
      Astral Construct moves out of range of the spell, it fades away into
      nothing, ending the spell.</p>

      <p>While the Astral Construct is active, you can spend psi points up to
      your per use limit to issue commands that affect and empower your
      construct. Commands require no action, but you can’t exceed your psi point
      limit in total commands issued, and each command can only be issued once
      per turn.</p>

      <p><strong>Grab (1 psi point):</strong> Can only be used while your
      construct is Solidified. A target creature within 5 feet of your construct
      that is no more than one size larger than the construct must make a
      Strength saving throw or become restrained by the construct. At the end of
      each of the restrained creature’s turns it can repeat the saving throw.
      The condition ends if the construct becomes ethereal again, or becomes
      more than one size smaller than the target.</p>

      <p><strong>Grow (1 psi point):</strong> Your construct increases by one
      size, and its number of damage dice increases by one. It returns to its
      normal size at the start of your next turn. It can only gain one
      additional die (for example, up to 2d8).</p>

      <p><strong>Relocate (1 psi point):</strong> The construct disappears and
      reappears anywhere within 60 feet of you.</p>

      <p><strong>Replicate (3 psi points):</strong> You use Relocate, but the
      original doesn’t disappear. Until the end of your turn, you have another
      construct and control both with the same action (commands only affect one
      of your choice). Pick one construct to fade at the start of your next turn
      or use Sustain.</p>

      <p><strong>Solidify (1 psi point):</strong> Your construct becomes solid,
      blocking its space until the start of your next turn. You can only use
      this command if it is in an unoccupied space. It has an armor class of 16
      and hit points equal to your Intelligence modifier + your psion level. The
      construct becomes ethereal again if it drops to zero hit points.</p>

      <p><strong>Strike (2 psi points):</strong> The construct makes an attack
      (even if it has already attacked).</p>

      <p><strong>Sustain (1+ psi points):</strong> At the start of your turn,
      you can sustain the effect of a Solidify, Grow or Replicate command for an
      additional round. An effect that has been replicated can be sustained
      across all replicated constructs with a single use, but each effect can
      only be sustained once per turn (for example, you can never sustain more
      than one replicated construct). This costs 1 psi point for each effect
      sustained. Sustaining Solidify refreshes the construct’s hit points to its
      maximum.</p>

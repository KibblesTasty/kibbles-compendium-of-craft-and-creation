  description:
    value: "<p><em>Prerequisite: Elemental Emotions</em></p>\n<p>You can manifest your emotions into elemental powers that take physical shape. While you are in an elemental emotion, you can expend 2 psi points to manifest that emotion into the world as a bonus action; this takes the form of a mephit (ice mephit for cold, magma mephit for fire, and dust mephit for lightning).\_</p>\n<p>As your emotion, given form, it acts immediately after your initiative at your directive. If not destroyed, it lasts for up to 1 minute, after which it naturally fades away. You canâ€™t manifest more than one emotion at a time, and if it is destroyed, you take 2d6 psychic damage from the backlash.</p>\n<p>This manifestation is not a sentient creature of its own, but simply a manifestation of your emotion.</p>"

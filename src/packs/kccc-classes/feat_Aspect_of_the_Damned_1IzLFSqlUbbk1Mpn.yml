      <p>(Prerequisite: Curse Eater, 2 upgrades consumed)</p>

      <p>The powers you have pilfered for your soul have tainted it... naturally
      this gives you great power. In addition to the powers you have gained from
      your upgrades, select two of the following powers to permanently gain:</p>

      <ul>

      <li><strong>Aberrant Life:</strong> You no longer count as a humanoid
      creature. Your creature type becomes Aberration.</li>

      <li><strong>Creature of Darkness:</strong> Your eyes become inky black
      pools. You can see normally in darkness, both magical and nonmagical, to a
      distance of 120 feet.</li>

      <li><strong>Hungering Soul:</strong> Once per turn on your turn while you
      are grappling or grappled by another creature, you can inflict 1d8
      necrotic damage to them as you sap their life force through the contact.
      Any healing they receive that turn is reduced by half.</li>

      <li><strong>Physical Mutation:</strong> The darkness within warps your
      body. You can choose an unrestricted Fleshsmith upgrade (it must be one
      that affects your body).</li>

      <li><strong>Unlife:</strong> You have found yourself in an odd half-living
      state. You gain resistance to necrotic damage, and you no longer need to
      consume food.</li>

      </ul>

  description:
    value: "<p>Long ago you forged great power; now you realize its full potential. Your cursed weapon becomes a true artifact. Any bonus to attack and damage rolls lower than +3 it has is replaced by a bonus of +3, and it gains two additional properties from the following list:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>While attuned to this artifact, you are immune to disease.</li>\n<li>While attuned to this artifact, you canâ€™t be charmed or frightened.</li>\n<li>While attuned to this artifact, you can cast a 1st or 2nd level spell of your choice from any spell list once per short rest without expending a spell slot (choose the spell when this upgrade is selected).</li>\n<li>While attuned to this artifact, you can treat a 1 on a death saving throw as a 20.</li>\n<li>While attuned to this artifact, one of your ability scores (chosen when this upgrade is selected) increases by 1, to a maximum of 24.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>When you select this upgrade, you can select the conditions by which your weapon can be destroyed. Your weapon can no longer be permanently destroyed by any other means. This means can be absurd or implausible, but must be something potentially possible.\_</p>"

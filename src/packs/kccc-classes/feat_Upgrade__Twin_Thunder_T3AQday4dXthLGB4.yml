      <p>You can attune to two one-handed Stormforged Weapons at the same time,
      so long as they either share the same Upgrades, or have total Upgrades
      equal to your maximum Upgrade count between them. Attuning to a second
      weapon this way doesn’t count against your maximum number of attuned
      items. If you make an attack with one of them while holding the other, you
      can attack with the other as a bonus action, however, both share the same
      use of Thundermonger. You don’t add your ability modifier to the damage of
      the bonus attack, unless that modifier is negative or you have the
      Two-Weapon Fighting Fighting Style.</p>

      <p>While dual wielding Stormforged Weapon, you can load a Stormforged
      Weapon without a free hand.</p>

    value: >-
      <p>At 11th level, you gain the ability to exert great feats of psionic
      power. Choose one 6th-level spell from the psion spell list as an innate
      ability. You can use this innate ability to cast that spell once. You must
      finish a long rest before you can do so again. At higher levels, you gain
      more innate abilities of your choice that can be used in this way: one
      7th-level spell at 13th level, one 8th-level spell at 15th level, and one
      9th-level spell at 17th level. You regain all uses of your Innate Psionics
      when you finish a long rest.</p>

      <p>Innate Psionics are well beyond the normal scope of your powers and are
      not restricted by what disciplines you have. Unlike psionic disciplines,
      they require any component the spell requires.</p>

      <p>At 2nd level, as part of your study of magic you gain the ability to
      cast spells. The spells you learn are limited in scope, primarily
      concerned with modifying creatures and objects or creating items.</p>

      <h2>Spell Slots</h2>

      <p>The Inventor table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your
      inventor spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you
      must expend a slot of the spellâ€™s level or higher. You regain all expended
      spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p>

      <p>For example, if you know the 1st-level spell longstrider and have a
      1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast longstrider
      using either slot.</p>

      <h2>Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher</h2>

      <p>You know three 1st-level spells of your choice from the inventor spell
      list.</p>

      <p>The Spells Known column of the Inventor table shows when you learn more
      inventor spells of your choice. Each of these spells must be of a level
      for which you have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 5th level in
      this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.</p>

      <p>Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one
      of the inventor spells you know and replace it with another spell from the
      inventor spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have
      spell slots.</p>

      proficiency bonus +</p>

      <p style="text-align:center">your Intelligence modifier</p>

      <p style="text-align:center"><strong>Spell attack modifier </strong>= your
      proficiency bonus +</p>

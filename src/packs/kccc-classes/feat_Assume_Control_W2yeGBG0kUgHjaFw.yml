      <p><em>(Prerequisite: Emergency Protocol)</em></p>

      <p>You expand the control available to your armor’s sentience. You can set
      additional conditions when your armor will take control of your movement
      and actions, and it can maintain this control for up to 1 minute.</p>

      <p>While acting in this mode, it can take any action you could take
      (including attacking), but can only cast spells granted by Upgrades. It
      uses your ability scores.</p>

      <p>The triggering event can be a preset condition, a verbal command, or a
      specified time. Your armor is immune to the charmed, blinded, frightened,
      paralyzed, and poisoned conditions, and doesn’t suffer from exhaustion,
      ignoring these effects if you are under them.</p>

      <p>If you have Warplate, it can act in this way even when you are not
      wearing it (or are dead). When doing so, it uses the game statistics of
      animated armor with the following modifications: It has an intelligence of
      12 and it can cast any spells that come from Upgrades with a DC equal to
      your spell save DC.</p>

      <p>This counts as a use of your Emergency Protocol, and it can’t control
      the armor again (in either way) until you finish a short or long rest.</p>

      <p>In non-combat situations in which you are not wearing your armor, your
      armor’s sentience can exert a lesser control of the armor to move it about
      and perform simple tasks. During this time it has the statistics of an
      unseen servant, though it looks like your suit of armor. Its ability to do
      this is not limited, but it takes 1 minute to assume this kind of control
      of your armor, and it can only do so while you are not wearing it. If
      reduced to zero hit points, the armor is incapacitated until you repair it
      during a long rest, but it can still serve as armor.</p>

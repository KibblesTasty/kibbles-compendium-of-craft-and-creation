    value: >-
      <p>You can use your mind to create a burst of elemental power, blasting a
      target you can see within range. Make a ranged spell attack against the
      target. On a hit, the target takes 1d8 cold, fire, force or lightning
      damage.</p>

      <p>For each die of cold damage dealt, the creature’s speed is reduced by 5
      feet until the end of their next turn. For each die of fire damage dealt
      by the original attack, the creature takes 1d4 fire damage at the start of
      its next turn. For each die of lightning damage dealt, an arc of lightning
      strikes another creature of your choice within 30 feet of the target,
      dealing 1d4 lightning damage (multiple arcs may strike the same creature).
      Damage from these secondary effects doesn’t add any bonuses (such as
      Empowered Psionics).</p>

      <p>You can spend psi points up to your per use limit to add the following
      modifiers to (you can add multiple modifiers). The points must be spent
      when choosing the target of the power.</p>

      <p><strong>Amplified (1+ psi points):</strong> The target takes an extra
      1d8 cold, fire, force or lightning damage on a hit for each additional
      point spent.</p>

      <p><strong>Lasting (1 psi point):</strong> Your Elemental Blast leaves a
      5-foot-radius sphere of devastation behind where it strikes until the
      start of your next turn. Creatures that enter this zone for the first time
      or end their turn in it must make a Constitution saving throw or suffer
      the secondary effects (slow, burn, arc) of the blast as if they had been
      hit by it.</p>

      <p><strong>Massive (1–3 psi points):</strong> You unleash a massive blast;
      rather than making an attack roll, all creatures within a 15-foot cone
      must make a Dexterity Saving throw. On failure, they take the effect as if
      hit by the Elemental Blast. The size of the cone is doubled for each point
      up to 3 spent (2 points for 30 feet, 3 points for 60 feet).</p>

      <p><strong>Overcharged (0 psi points):</strong> You take 1d4 force damage
      and do not add your proficiency bonus from the attack or spell save DC for
      your Elemental Blast, but increase the damage it deals by twice your
      proficiency bonus.</p>

      <p>As an action, you can open this casting gust without verbal or somatic
      components. Alternatively, you can breath from it, letting out only a
      little bit at a time, breathing directly from the bottle, but each time
      you must make a DC 5 athletics checks. On failure, you cast gust as above
      and all the air is lost. You can get 10 minutes of breathable air from one
      bottle.</p>

  description:
    value: "<p>Drinking this potion allows you to zip around for 1 minute as pure electricity. As a bonus action on each of your turns before the effect ends, you can transform into a bolt of lightning and instantly travel in a straight line to an unoccupied space you can see within 30 feet. This movement doesn’t provoke opportunity attacks and you are immune to lightning damage while in this form.\_</p>\n<p>You can pass through small holes, narrow openings, and even mere cracks, as well as through conductive materials such as metal. Each creature in your travel path must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, or take [[/damage 3d6 lightning]] damage. You immediately revert to your normal form upon reaching the destination. This potion’s stormy liquid arcs with tiny bolts of lightning and it numbs the tongue when sipped.</p>"

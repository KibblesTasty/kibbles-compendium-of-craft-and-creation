  description:
    value: >-
      <p>A simple construction of a two chambered projectile (typically made of
      glass). When you add an Alchemist Fire and an Explosive to its separate
      compartments, it becomes an incredibly dangerous device. As an action, a
      character can light this bomb and throw it at a point up to 60 feet away.
      Creatures within the range of the explosive used must make a Dexterity
      saving throw against the DC of the explosive used, or take damage equal to
      the explosion + [[/damage 1d4 piercing]] damage + [[/damage 1d4 fire]]
      damage.</p>

      <p>A bundled explosive alchemical preparation. It can be detonated by
      dealing 1 fire or lightning damage to it. As an action, a packet of this
      explosive can be accurately thrown 20 feet, but will not detonate on
      impact (usually). When it detonates, all creatures within 10 feet (for
      common) of the target point must make a Dexterity saving throw with a DC
      equal to the crafter’s Alchemy DC. On failure, they take [[/r 4d8]] fire +
      [[/damage 4d8 thunder]] damage, or half as much on a success. Creatures in
      range of more than one explosive take damage only from the highest damage
      effect.</p>

      <p>You can fuse your explosives. When fused, intentionally dealing fire
      damage to the explosives (or otherwise lighting the fuse) causes it to
      detonate on a delay, selected from: short (the end of your turn), medium
      (the start of your next turn), and long (2 rounds, at the start of your
      turn).</p>

    value: >-
      <p>A fine grey powder with large grains and the faint smell of sulfur and
      charcoal that comes in small packets weighing 1/2 pound.</p>

      <p>When ignited by 1 or more fire or lightning damage, it explodes
      violently. All creatures within 10 feet of it must make a DC 14 Dexterity
      saving throw. On failure, they take [[/r 1d4]] fire + [[/damage 1d4
      thunder]] damage, or half as much on a success. The amount of damage
      increases by [[/r 1d4]] (both the fire and thunder) and the radius
      increases by 5 feet for each additional packet of Blasting Powder
      detonated in the same spot, up to a maximum of five packets. Deals double
      damage to buildings and structures. Creatures in range of more than one
      stack of up to 5 explosives at the same time take damage only from the
      highest damage effect.</p>

      <p>Frequently used for mining and other responsible things... until
      adventurers get their hands on it.</p>

      <p>Only dwarves really know if the name of this liquid explosive is a joke
      or not, but must assume it is an acquired taste. An explosively flammable
      liquid that comes in a flask, this flask can be splashed across a 5 foot
      square within 5 feet. Once splashed, it can be ignited by 1 or more fire
      or lightning damage. When ignited it explodes in a plume of fire, dealing
      [[/damage 2d4 fire]] damage to all creatures within 5 feet of the
      container, or within a square that has been soaked with it.</p>

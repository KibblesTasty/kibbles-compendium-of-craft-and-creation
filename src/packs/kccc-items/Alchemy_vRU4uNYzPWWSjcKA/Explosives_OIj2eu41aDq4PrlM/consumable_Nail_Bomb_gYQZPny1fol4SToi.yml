    value: >-
      <p>A brutal instrument, this mixes explosive powder and nails to create a
      devastating fragmentation device. An exceedingly dangerous device. Heavier
      and more deadly than other explosives, the primary damage comes from the
      metal shrapnel (nails) flung in all directions. It can be detonated by
      dealing 1 fire or lightning damage to it. As an action, a packet of this
      explosive can be accurately thrown 20 feet, but will not detonate on
      impact (usually). When it detonates, all creatures within 20 feet of the
      target point must make a Dexterity saving throw with a DC equal to the
      crafterâ€™s Alchemy DC. On failure, they take [[/damage 8d4 piercing]]
      damage, or half as much on a success.</p>

      <p>You can fuse your explosives. When fused, intentionally dealing fire
      damage to the explosives (or otherwise lighting the fuse) causes it to
      detonate on a delay, selected from: short (the end of your turn), medium
      (the start of your next turn), and long (2 rounds, at the start of your
      turn).</p>

    value: >-
      <p>A fine grey powder with large grains and the faint smell of sulfur and
      charcoal that comes in small packets weighing 1/2 pound.</p>

      <p>When ignited by 1 or more fire or lightning damage, it releases a blast
      of thick black smoke that fills a 20-foot radius. Everything in this smoke
      is heavily obscured for [[/r 2d4]] rounds. At the start of your next turn
      after the number of rounds rolled, the smoke begins to fade leaving
      everything within the radius lightly obscured, and it clears completely at
      the start of your next turn after that.</p>

      <p>Additional uses of the smoke powder extend the duration of heavy
      obscurement for an extra [[/r 1d4]] rounds.</p>

      <p><em>Potion, legendary</em></p>

      <p>When you drink this potion, you regain all lost hit points, all status
      effects are removed, all reductions to ability scores are removed, any
      missing limbs are restored, all diseases are cured, all curses are
      removed, and all levels of exhaustions are removed, and you cease to age
      for 1 year. This potion can remove effects that can otherwise only be
      removed by wish.</p>

      <p>If you ever drink a second panacea potion, make a DC 30 Constitution
      saving throw. On failure, you gain no benefits from it and die.</p>

      <p>This object appears as a wooden box that measures 12 inches long, 6
      inches wide, and 6 inches deep. It weighs 4 pounds and floats. It can be
      opened to store items inside. This item also has three command words, each
      requiring you to use an action to speak it.</p><p> One command word causes
      the box to unfold into a cart with two wheels that can be drawn by a
      person or horse. This can comfortable seat up 2 medium creatures with room
      for storage and weighs 200 lb. </p><p>The second command word causes the
      box to unfold into a wagon with four wheels that can be drawn be a horse
      or team of horses. This can comfortable seat 6 people with room for
      storage and weighs 400 lb. </p><p>The third command word causes the
      folding cart to fold back into a box, provided that no creatures are
      aboard. Any objects in the cart that can't fit inside the box remain
      outside the box as it folds. Any objects in the cart that can fit inside
      the box do so.</p>

      <p><em>Poison, uncommon</em></p>

      <p>When released, this poison fills a 10-foot radius around the source.
      You can accurately throw a vial of it (shattering on impact) at a point up
      to 30 feet away, or release it by other means. A creature subjected to
      this poison must make a Constitution saving throw with a DC equal to the
      crafter's Poison DC.</p>

      <p>On failure, they take 4d4 Poison damage and become Poisoned for 1 hour.
      At the end of a poisoned creatureâ€™s turn, it can repeat the saving throw,
      ending the condition on success.</p>

      <p>This effect lingers in the area it was released for 1d4 rounds. A
      strong wind will clear away and disperse the poison. A creature that
      enters the area for the first time must save against the poison.</p>

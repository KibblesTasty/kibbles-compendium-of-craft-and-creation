      <p>While wearing bracers and not using a shield, as a reaction to being
      hit by an attack, you can attempt to parry the attack with your bracer,
      adding +2 AC bonus against the triggering attack. If this causes your AC
      to be exactly equal to the attack roll and the attacking weapon is made of
      a common metal, the attacking weapon is destroyed.</p>

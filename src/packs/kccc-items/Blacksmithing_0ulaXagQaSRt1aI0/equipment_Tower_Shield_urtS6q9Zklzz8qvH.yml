    value: >-
      <p>This is a massive unwieldy shield. While carrying it, your speed is
      reduced by 10 feet. At the end of each of your turns, pick a direction .
      You have half cover from attacks in a cone that direction. Alternatively,
      you can pick a single target, tracking the movement. You have half cover
      against attacks from that target (and only that target).</p>

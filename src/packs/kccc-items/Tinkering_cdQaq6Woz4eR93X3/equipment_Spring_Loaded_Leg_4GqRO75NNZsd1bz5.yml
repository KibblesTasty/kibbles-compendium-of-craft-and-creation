      <p>A functional mechanical leg that can replace a missing one. While
      attuned in this way, it functions the same as the limb it replaces.
      Additionally, it can absorb a great deal of impact when falling and spring
      to new heights. You can reduce all falling damage by 20 feet, and your
      jumping distance is doubled. After falling, your jumping distance is
      further increased by a quarter of the distance fallen. </p>

      <p>This bizarre buckler has a lantern, a gauntlet, defensive spikes, and a
      short sword built into it. You must wear the gauntlet in order to wield
      it, and it only grants a +1 bonus to AC. The bullseye lantern concealed
      within the shield casts bright light in a 60-foot cone and dim light for
      an additional 60 feet. Once lit, it burns for 6 hours on a flask (1 pint)
      of oil. The aperture that sheds light through the shield can be opened or
      closed with a bonus action while wearing the gauntlet, instantly igniting
      or extinguishing the lantern.</p><p> While the lantern is covered and you
      are attacked in darkness by a creature within 60 feet of you that is also
      in darkness, you can reveal the light (no action required) to momentarily
      blind the attacker, imposing disadvantage on the attack. A creature can’t
      be blinded in this way again for 24 hours. </p><p>If a creature within 5
      feet of you misses you with a melee attack, you can use your reaction to
      deal 1d4 piercing damage to the attacker with the shield’s defensive
      spikes. </p><p>Additionally, the shield has a shortsword built into it
      that can be wielded while wearing the gauntlet. You can deploy or retract
      it with a bonus action. You have a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls
      with this shortsword and you are proficient with this weapon if you are
      proficient with shields. Attacks with this weapon are made with
      disadvantage if you are holding a weapon without the light property, or an
      object longer than 1 foot or heavier than 5 pounds in your gauntlet
      hand.</p>

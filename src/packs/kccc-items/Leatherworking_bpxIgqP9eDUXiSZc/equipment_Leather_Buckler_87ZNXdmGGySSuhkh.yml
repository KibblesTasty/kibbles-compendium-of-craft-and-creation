      <p>A small, simple, and light shield. Wielding this sheild increases your
      armor class by 1. You can benefit from only one shield at a time. You can
      hold items in the same hand as this light buckler, but any weapon wielded
      with the same hand has disadvantage on weapon attacks, and any grappling
      attempts with that hand are made with disadvantage.</p>

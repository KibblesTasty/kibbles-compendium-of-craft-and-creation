      <p>This is a quick access bandolier that can hold weapons with the thrown
      property. It can be configured to hold 2 javalins, handaxes, or light
      hammers, or 4 daggers or darts. Weapons held in it can drawn as part of
      making an attack with them without using an object interaction to draw
      them as long as you have a free hand to draw them.</p>

      <p><em>Food (snack), uncommon</em></p>

      <p>A stick of hard tacky substance. You can pop one into your mouth as a
      bonus action. While being sucked (for up to 10 minutes), you gain expanded
      senses and have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks, saving throws
      against Illusion spells, and Intelligence (Investigation) checks to see
      through illusions, though because of the bad taste inherent to the
      formulation, continuing to suck on the seeing stick requires
      concentration, as if concentrating on a spell.</p>

      <p>By adding the optional common supplies ingredient, they can be
      sweetened, granting you advantage on Constitution saving throws made to
      maintain your concentration against spitting them out; this increases the
      DC of the recipe by 1.</p>

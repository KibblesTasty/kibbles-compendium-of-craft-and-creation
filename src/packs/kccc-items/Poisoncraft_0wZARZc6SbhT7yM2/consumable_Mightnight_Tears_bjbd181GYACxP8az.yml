      <p><em>Poison, uncommon</em></p>

      <p>A creature that ingests this poison suffers no Effect until the stroke
      of midnight. If the poison has not been neutralized before then, the
      creature must succeed on a Constitution saving throw with a DC equal to
      the crafter's Poison DC, taking [[/damage 9d6 poison average]] damage on a
      failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</p>

      <p>Applied to a melee weapon or up to 5 pieces of ammunition.</p>

      <p>A creature subjected to this poison must make a Constitution saving
      throw with a DC equal to the crafter's Poison DC, taking 6d6 poison damage
      on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful save.</p>

      <p>Once applied, the poison retains potency for 1 minute before drying,
      and wears off of a weapon after that weapon has delivered the effect 5
      times.</p>

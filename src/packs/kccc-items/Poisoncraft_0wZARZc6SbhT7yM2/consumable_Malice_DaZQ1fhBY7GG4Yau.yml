      <p>When released (by throwing powder or breaking a vial of it), this
      poison affects a 5-foot radius from where it was released. A creature
      subjected to this poison must make a Constitution saving throw with a DC
      equal to the crafter's Poison DC.</p>

      <p>On failure, the creature becomes Poisoned for 1 hour. The Poisoned
      creature is Blinded.</p>

      <p>If stored as powder, you can throw this powder 5 feet. If stored in a
      vial, you can throw 20 feet.</p>

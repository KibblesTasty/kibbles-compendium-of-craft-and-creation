      <p><em>Poison, very rare</em></p>

      <p>Applied to food or beverage. A creature that consumes this poison
      begins to slowly die if they aren’t immune to poison. Each time that
      creature finishes a long rest, its hit point maximum is reduced by 1. If
      the creature’s hit point maximum hit is reduced to 0 by this effect, it
      dies. While its hit points are less than half of its original maximum, it
      is poisoned. This effect can be removed by effects that remove the
      poisoned condition, and can be only be identified by magic or a DC 15
      Wisdom (Medicine) check.</p>

      <p>If a creature is cured, it regains its lost hit points after it
      finishes a long rest.</p>

      <p><em>Poison, rare</em></p>

      <p>Applied to a melee weapon or up to 5 pieces of ammunition. A creature
      subjected to this poison must make a Constitution saving throw with a DC
      equal to the crafter's Poison DC.</p>

      <p>On failure, the target becomes poisoned for 1 minute. A creature is
      paralyzed while poisoned this way. At the end of each of the creature’s
      turns, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on success.</p>

      <p>Once applied, the poison retains potency for 1 minute before drying,
      and wears off of a weapon after that weapon has delivered the effect 5
      times.</p>

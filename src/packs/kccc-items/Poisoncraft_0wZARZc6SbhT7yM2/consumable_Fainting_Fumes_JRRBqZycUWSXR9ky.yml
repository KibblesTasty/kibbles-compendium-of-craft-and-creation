      <p><em>Poison, rare</em></p>

      <p>When released, this poison fills a 10-foot radius around the source.
      You can accurately throw a vial of it (shattering on impact) at a point up
      to 30 feet away, or release it by other means. A creature subjected to
      this poison must make a Constitution saving throw with a DC equal to the
      crafter's Poison DC. On failure, the target becomes poisoned for 1 hour.
      If the saving throw fails by 5 or more, the creature is also unconscious
      while poisoned in this way. The creature wakes up if it takes damage or if
      another creature takes an action to shake it awake.</p>

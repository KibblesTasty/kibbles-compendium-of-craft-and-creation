      <p><em>Poison, uncommon</em></p>

      <p>Applied to a melee weapon or up to 5 pieces of ammunition. A creature
      subjected to this poison must make a Constitution saving throw with a DC
      equal to the crafter's Poison DC.</p>

      <p>On failure, the target becomes poisoned for 1 minute. While poisoned
      this way, a creature takes 1d6 fire damage at the end of each of its
      turns, and any hit points regained is reduced by half. At the end of each
      of their turns, they can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on
      success.</p>

      <p>Once applied, the poison retains potency for 1 minute before drying,
      and wears off of a weapon after that weapon has delivered the effect 5
      times.</p>

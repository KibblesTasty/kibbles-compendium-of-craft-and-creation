      <p><em>Poison, rare</em></p>

      <p>When released, this poison fills a 5-foot radius around the source. You
      can accurately throw a vial of it (shattering on impact) at a point up to
      30 feet away, or release it by other means. A creature subjected to this
      poison must make a Constitution saving throw with a DC equal to the
      crafter's Poison DC.</p>

      <p>On failure, the creature becomes Poisoned for 8 hours. The Poisoned
      creature is Unconscious. The creature wakes up if it takes damage or if
      another creature takes an action to shake it awake.</p>

      <p>If stored as powder, you can throw this powder 5 feet. If stored in a
      vial, you can throw 30 feet.</p>

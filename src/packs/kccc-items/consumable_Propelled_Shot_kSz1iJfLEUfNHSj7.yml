      <p>This is a special shot that contains a dangerous rocket like propellant
      accelerating it to greater speed and distance. This shot can be fired at a
      weaponâ€™s long range without disadvantage, and does an additional weapon
      die of damage on hit. However, targets gain twice the bonus to AC from
      cover against this shot as they are difficult to arc.</p>

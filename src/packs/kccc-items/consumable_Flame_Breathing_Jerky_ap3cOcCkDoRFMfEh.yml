      <p><em>Food (snack), uncommon</em></p>

      <p>A tough jerky with exotic flavoring. Very spicy, uncomfortably so.
      After a creature consumes this snack as an action, they gain the following
      benefits for the next 10 minutes:</p>

      <ul>

      <li>You canâ€™t be put to sleep by magical means.</li>

      <li>You have disadvantage on Wisdom checks.</li>

      <li>You have disadvantage on Constitution saving throws to maintain
      concentration on a spell.</li>

      <li>You can use a bonus action to exhale fire at a target within 10 feet
      of you. The target must make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw, taking 2d6
      fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful
      one.</li>

      </ul>

      <p>You can eat a number of pieces of this jerky equal to your Constitution
      modifier per day.</p>

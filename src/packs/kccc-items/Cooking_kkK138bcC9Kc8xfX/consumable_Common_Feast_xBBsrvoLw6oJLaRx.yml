      <p><em>Food (feast), common</em></p>

      <p>Up to 5 creatures can consume this feast within an hour of it being
      prepared. After consuming this hearty meal, you become satiated for the
      next 24 hours. This is a hearty meal well surpassing the benefits of
      normal meals or rations, and each creature that consumes it regains an
      additional Hit Die during the next long rest.</p>

      <p>If cooked by a creature with proficiency in cook’s utensils, creatures
      that consume this feast regain additional Hit Dice equal to the cook’s
      proficiency bonus during the next long rest instead.</p>

      <p><em>Food (feast), uncommon</em></p>

      <p>Up to 5 creatures can consume this feast within an hour of it being
      prepared. After consuming this dubious meal, you gain resistance to poison
      damage, and gain advantage on saving throws against being poisoned for 24
      hours.</p>

      <p>If the source of a poison saving throw is the same as the source of the
      meat or poisonous reagent used to make the feast, the advantage against
      being poisoned by that creature or effect lasts one week.</p>

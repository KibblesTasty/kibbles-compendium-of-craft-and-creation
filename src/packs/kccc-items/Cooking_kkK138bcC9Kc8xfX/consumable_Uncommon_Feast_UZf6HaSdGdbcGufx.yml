      <p><em>Food (feast), uncommon/rare/very rare/legendary</em></p>

      <p>Up to 5 creatures can consume this feast within an hour of it being
      prepared. After consuming this hearty meal, you become satiated for the
      next 24 hours. You gain the benefits for a common feast, but can gain
      additional benefits by trading in Hit Dice that would be gained as part of
      your next long rest after consuming this meal. These Hit Dice are consumed
      after calculating how many you would have after the rest (including the
      benefits of the feast), but you can trade Hit Dice in this way you would
      normally lose if you have more than your maximum Hit Dice.</p>

      <p>You can trade Hit Dice in this way up to a number equal to your
      proficiency bonus. The benefits scale based on the rarity on the
      feast.</p>

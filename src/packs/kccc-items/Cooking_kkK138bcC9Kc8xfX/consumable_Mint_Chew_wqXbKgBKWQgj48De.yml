      <p><em>Food (snack), uncommon</em></p>

      <p>A chewy minty candy. You can pop one into your mouth as a bonus action.
      While being chewed (for up to 10 minutes), you are energized and can
      ignore the effects of up to 3 levels of Exhaustion for the duration, and
      can’t be put to sleep by magical means.</p>

      <p>You can only gain this benefit once per day, after which consuming
      additional pieces of the candy has no effect until you finish a long
      rest.</p>

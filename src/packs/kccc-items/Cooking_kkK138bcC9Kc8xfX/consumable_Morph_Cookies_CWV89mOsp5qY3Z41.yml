      <p>Consuming one of these has the effects of casting
      @Compendium[dnd5e.spells.8RTDOt80u8aBv9qx]{Alter Self}, however you can’t
      change the adaptation unless you consume another cookie. This effect
      doesn’t require concentration to maintain, and can be extended by
      consuming an additional morph cookie.</p>

      <p>If the ingredient came from a mimic, you can additionally transform
      your appearance to creatures with a different basic shape than you, though
      you remain the same size.</p>

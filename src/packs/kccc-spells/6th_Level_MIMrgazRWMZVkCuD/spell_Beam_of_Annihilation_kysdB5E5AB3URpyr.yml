    value: >-
      <p>You unleash a beam of pure energy, selecting cold, fire, force, or
      lightning energy when you cast this spell and blasting it outward in a
      line that is 60 feet long and 10 feet wide that persists until the start
      of your next turn. Any creature that starts their turn in this beam must
      make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save they take [[/r 8d8]]
      damage of the beam's energy type, or taking half as much on a successful
      save.</p>

      <p>While you are concentrating on this spell, your movement speed is zero.
      At the start of each of your turns, you can use your action to maintain
      the beam or redirect it, rotating it up to 90 degrees in any direction.
      Any creature the beam passes through while rotating (if the beam passes
      completely through them and they will not start their turn inside of it)
      must make a Dexterity saving throw or, take [[/r 4d8]] damage of the beams
      energy type on a failed save, and taking no damage on a successful
      save.</p>

      <p>If you do not use your action maintain or redirect it, the spell ends
      early.</p>

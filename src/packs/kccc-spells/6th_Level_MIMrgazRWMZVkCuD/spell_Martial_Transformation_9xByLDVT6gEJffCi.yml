    value: >-
      <p>You endow yourself with endurance and martial prowess fueled by magic.
      Until the spell ends, you can't cast spells or concentrate them, and you
      gain the following benefits:</p>

      <ul>

      <li>You gain [[/r 50]] temporary hit points. If any of these remain when
      the spell ends, they are lost.</li>

      <li>You have advantage on attack rolls that you make with simple and
      martial weapons.</li>

      <li>When you hit a target with a weapon attack, that target takes an extra
      [[/damage 2d12 force]] damage.</li>

      <li>You have proficiency with all armor, shields, simple weapons, and
      martial weapons.</li>

      <li>You have proficiency in Strength and Constitution saving throws.</li>

      <li>You can attack twice, instead of once, when you take the Attack action
      on your turn. You ignore this benefit if you already have a feature, like
      Extra Attack, that gives you extra attacks.</li>

      <li>You can conjure and equip (as part of the action used to cast the
      spell) and set of heavy or medium armor and any simple or martial weapon
      of your choice. These items have no strength requirements and are magical
      in nature though have the same properties as their nonmagical
      counterparts, vanishing when the spell ends.</li>

      </ul>

      <p>Immediately after the spell ends, you must succeed on a DC 15
      Constitution saving throw or suffer one level of exhaustion.</p>

      <p>You create an overwhelming gravitational singularity at a point within
      range that lasts until the start of your next turn. When you cast this
      spell, any creature within 15 feet of the point must make a Strength
      saving throw. Creatures that fail their saving throw are moved to the
      closest available space adjacent to the singularity and take [[/damage 3d6
      bludgeoning]] damage, and an additional [[/damage 1d6 bludgeoning]] damage
      for each other creature that fails the saving throw, up to a maximum of
      [[/r 6d6]] bludgeoning damage.</p>

      <p>While within 15 feet of the singularity, moving away from the
      singularity requires twice as much movement. If a creature ends its turn
      within 15 feet of the singularity, it must make a Strength saving throw.
      On failure, they take [[/damage 2d6 bludgeoning]] damage are dragged back
      to the closest available spot to the center of the singularity.</p>

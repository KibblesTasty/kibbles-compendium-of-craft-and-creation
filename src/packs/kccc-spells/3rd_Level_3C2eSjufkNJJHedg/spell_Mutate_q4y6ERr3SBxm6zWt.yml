    value: "<p>You manipulate the nature of your body with magic temporarily giving it new properties. You can select three of the following properties:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Your body becomes malleable and amorphous. You have advantage on saves and checks against grapples and the restrained condition, you do not suffer disadvantage from squeezing into smaller spaces, and you can squeeze through openings two sizes smaller than you.</li>\n<li>You grow one additional appendage. This appendage serves as an arm and a hand, though it can take the shape of an arm, tentacle, or similar appendage.</li>\n<li>You extend the length of your limbs, increasing the reach on melee attacks, touch spells, and object interactions by 5 feet.</li>\n<li>Your flesh hardens, your base AC becomes 14 + your dexterity modifier if it is not already higher.</li>\n<li>You grow more resilient, adapting against one external threat. You gain advantage on one type of saving throw of your choice.</li>\n<li>You adapt your body to an aquatic environment, sprouting gills and growing webbing between your fingers. You can breathe underwater and gain a swimming speed equal to your walking speed.</li>\n<li>Your body grows ablative armor. You gain temporary hit points equal to your spellcasting ability modifier at the start of each of your turns.</li>\n<li>You can grow one size larger or smaller.</li>\n<li>You sprout wings. You gain a flying speed of 30 feet.</li>\n<li>You grow a natural weapon; this weapon can have the statistics of any martial melee weapon without the thrown property, and takes on a form vaguely reminiscent of it. You have proficiency with this weapon, and are considered to be holding it. You can use your spellcasting modifier in place of your Strength or Dexterity modifier for attack and damage rolls with this natural weapon. The natural weapon is magic and you have a +1 bonus to the attack and damage rolls you make using it.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For the duration of the spell, you can use an action to change one or all of the properties, losing the benefits of your previously selected properties and gaining the benefits of the new selected properties.</p>\n<p><em><strong>At Higher Levels.</strong></em> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th or higher, you can select one additional property from the list of options, with one additional property per spell level above 3rd.</p>\n<p>\_</p>"

      <p>You weave an enchantment that conjures compresses all objects of your
      choice within range into a the satchel or bag used in casting the spell.
      The contents become harmlessly compressed and stored in an magical state
      of miniaturized suspension within the container. The weight of
      miniaturized stored items is the weight of the item divided by one
      hundred. The bag can store all items that fit in the radius when the spell
      is cast, but can’t store any individual item larger than Medium. Items
      can’t be individually removed from the bag, but the process can be
      reversed by casting the spell again, at which point all items are
      deposited from the bag in the arrangement they were before being
      stored.</p>

      <p>If the bag is destroyed or placed into an interdimensional space, the
      contents of the bag are instantly emptied onto the ground in a chaotic
      manner, each item taking [[/damage 4d4 force]] damage, but dealing no
      damage to anything else. If the bag is broken, the key used as a material
      in casting the spell breaks.</p>

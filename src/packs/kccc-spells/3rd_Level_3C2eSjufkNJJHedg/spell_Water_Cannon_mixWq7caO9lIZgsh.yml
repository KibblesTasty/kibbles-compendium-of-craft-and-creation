    value: >-
      <p>You unleash a spout of water that blasts out in a line 30-foot-long and
      5 foot-wide-line. Creatures in the area must make a Strength saving throw,
      or take [[/damage 6d6 bludgeoning]] damage and be pushed to an open space
      at the end of the line away from you. If there is no open space to move to
      (for example they would move into a wall or another creature), they are
      pushed to the closest space and take an additional [[/damage 2d6
      bludgeoning]] damage and are knocked prone. On a successful save, they
      take half as much damage and are not pushed.</p>

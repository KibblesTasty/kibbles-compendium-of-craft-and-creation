      <p>You teleport yourself to an unoccupied space you can see within range,
      leaving behind a spatial distortion. Each creature within 10 feet of the
      space you left must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failure, they take
      [[/damage 5d4 force]] damage and are teleported to an empty space of your
      choice within 5 feet of where they were. On success they take half as much
      damage and are not teleported.</p>

      <p>You can also teleport one willing creature of your size or smaller who
      is carrying gear up to its carrying capacity. The creature must be within
      5 feet of you when you cast this spell, and there must be an unoccupied
      space within 5 feet of your destination space for the creature to appear
      in; otherwise, the creature is left behind.</p>

      <p><em><strong>At Higher Levels.</strong></em> When you cast this spell
      using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage increases by [[/r
      2d4]] for each slot level above 3rd.</p>

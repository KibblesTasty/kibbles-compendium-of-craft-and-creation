    value: >-
      <p>You attempt to bind a creatures soul to a doll, linking the creature to
      the doll in a sympathetic link. The target must make a Charisma saving
      throw. On failure, the creature becomes bound to the doll. On a successful
      save, the creature is not bound and the spell ends.</p>

      <p>As part of casting the spell when the creature fails the save, and on
      subsequent turns using your action until the spell ends, you can perform
      one of the following actions:</p>

      <ul>

      <li>Hold the doll still, causing the creature to be Restrained until start
      of your next turn.</li>

      <li>Force the doll to move, causing the creature to move 15 feet in a
      direction of your choice that it can move.</li>

      <li>Stab the doll, causing the creature take 4d6 piercing damage.</li>

      <li>Rip the doll in half, ending the spell, destroying the doll, and
      dealing 4d12 necrotic damage to the creature.</li>

      <li>Each time after the first you use an action to manipulate the doll,
      after the effect takes place, the creature can repeat the Charisma with
      disadvantage, ending the effect on a successful save.</li>

      </ul>

      <p>Once a creature has been targeted by this spell, they cannot be
      targeted again for 24 hours.</p>

      <p><em><strong>At Higher Levels.</strong></em> When cast with a 5th level
      spell slot or above, the range of the spell becomes unlimited, as long as
      the target is on the same plane as the caster.</p>

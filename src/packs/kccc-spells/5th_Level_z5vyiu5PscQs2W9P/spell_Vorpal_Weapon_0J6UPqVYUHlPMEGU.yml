      <p>You touch a weapon and imbue it with power. Until the spell ends, the
      weapon becomes indescribably sharp, ignoring resistance to slashing
      damage, and gains the Siege property, dealing double damage to inanimate
      objects such as structures. If a weapon has a modifier of less than +3 to
      attack and damage rolls, its modifier becomes +3 to attack and damage
      rolls for the duration of the spell.</p><p>Additionally, if a critical
      strike of this weapon would leave a creature with less than 50 hit points,
      the target creature is decapitated, killing it.</p>

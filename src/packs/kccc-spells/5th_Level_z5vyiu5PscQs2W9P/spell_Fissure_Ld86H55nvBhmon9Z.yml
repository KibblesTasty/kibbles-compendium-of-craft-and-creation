    value: >-
      <p>You rend asunder the earth in a 60-foot-long 5-foot-wide line,
      targeting an area of dirt, sand, or rock at least 10 feet deep.</p>

      <p>Creatures in that line must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a
      failure, a creature falls into a suddenly opened crevice in the ground,
      falling into it before it snaps shut, crushing them. Creatures that fail
      the saving throw take [[/damage 6d10 bludgeoning]] damage from the fall
      and crushing. The creature is buried in 10 feet of rubble, and creatures
      without a burrowing speed require 25 feet of movement to extract
      themselves from the loose rubble to return to where they failed the saving
      throw. If they end their turn while buried, they take an additional [[/r
      1d10]] bludgeoning damage.</p>

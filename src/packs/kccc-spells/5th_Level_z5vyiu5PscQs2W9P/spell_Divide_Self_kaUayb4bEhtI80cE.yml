      <p>You you create an exact duplicate of yourself in an empty space you can
      see within 30 feet of you. When you cast this spell at the start of each
      of your turns for the duration, you can switch places with your
      duplicate.</p>

      <p>The duplicate has all of your stats, abilities, and equipment
      (including magic items). It acts on your initiative, and has its own
      actions, though it shares its concentration on this spell, and if either
      of you lose concentration, the spell ends.</p>

      <p>Your current hit points are divided between you and the duplicate and
      shares all other resources and abilities with you (including limited use
      magic items), with any usage by either you or the duplicate depleting the
      resource for both of you.</p>

      <p>Your duplicate can take any action you can take, but it can deal a
      maximum of 15 damage on its turn (any additional damage dealt deals no
      further damage, when dealing area of effect damage, damage is split
      between all targets equally up to the maximum).</p>

      <p>If either you or the duplicate is reduced to zero hit points, the spell
      ends and you become the copy that was not reduced to zero hit points. When
      the spell ends, if both you and the duplicate are still present, decide
      which is you, and the other vanishes. Anything that was copied during the
      spell has the copied version vanish.</p>

      <p><em><strong>At Higher Levels.</strong></em> When you cast this spell
      using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the starting hit points of you
      and the duplicate both increase by 15 (up to a maximum of you and the
      duplicate starting with your current hit points) and the maximum damage
      the duplicate can do during its turn increases by 10 for each slot level
      above 5th</p>

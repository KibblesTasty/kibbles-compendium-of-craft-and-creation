      <p>You alter gravity for yourself, causing you to reorient which way is
      down for you until the end of your turn. You can pick any direction to
      fall as if under the effect of gravity, falling up to 500 feet before the
      spell ends.</p>

      <p>If you collide with something during this time, you take falling damage
      as normal, but you can control your fall as you could under normal
      conditions by holding onto objects or move along a surface according to
      your new orientation as normal until your turn ends and gravity returns to
      normal.</p>

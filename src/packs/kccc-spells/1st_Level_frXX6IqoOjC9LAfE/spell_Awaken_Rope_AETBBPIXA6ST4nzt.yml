    value: >-
      <p>As an action, you can touch a rope 10 to 60 feet long and issue a
      single command to it, selecting from the following options:</p>

      <ul>

      <li><strong>Bind.</strong> The rope attempts to bind a creature of your
      choice within 20 feet of you. The creature must make a Dexterity saving
      throw or become restrained until it is freed. A creature can use its
      action to make a DC 10 Strength check, freeing itself or another creature
      within its reach on a success. Dealing 5 slashing damage to the rope (AC
      10) also frees the creature without harming it, ending the effect and
      destroying the rope.</li>

      <li><strong>Fasten.</strong> The rope flies up 60 feet and ties one end to
      an object or surface that a rope could be tied to, before becoming
      inanimate again, hanging from the object.</li>

      <li><strong>Grab.</strong> The rope lashes out grabs one Small or smaller
      object that is not being worn by a creature within a range equal to the
      length of the rope and pulls that object back to your hand. If that object
      is being carried by a creature, it must make a Strength saving throw. On
      success, it retains the object, and on failure the object is pulled from
      the creature.</li>

      </ul>

      <p><em><strong>At Higher Levels.</strong></em> When you cast this spell
      using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, you can target a chain instead
      of a rope. It has the same available actions, but it has a DC 15, an AC of
      15, and resistance to slashing damage when taking the Bind action. When
      cast with a spell slot of 3rd level or higher targeting a rope, that rope
      is magically imbued for 1 minute, gaining an DC of 15, an AC 20, and 20
      hit points.</p>

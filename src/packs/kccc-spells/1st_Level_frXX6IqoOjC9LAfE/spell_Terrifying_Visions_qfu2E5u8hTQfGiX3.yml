    value: >-
      <p>You instil a vision of terrifying hallucinations into the mind of a
      target you can see. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On
      failure, it takes [[/damage 3d6 psychic]] damage and must immediately use
      its reaction to move to move it's movement speed directly away from you.
      This movement does not force the creature to move into any hazard or take
      movements that cause it to take damage (such as jumping off a cliff or
      moving into a spell effect). On a successful save, the target takes half
      as much damage and isn't forced to move.</p>

      <p><em><strong>At Higher Levels.</strong></em> When you cast this spell
      using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for
      each slot level above 1st.</p>

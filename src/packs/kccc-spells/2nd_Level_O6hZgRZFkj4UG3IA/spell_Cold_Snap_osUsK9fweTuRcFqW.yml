  description:
    value: "<p>With a snap of your fingers a swirling burst of freezing wind erupts at a point you choose within range. Each creature in a 5-foot-radius sphere centered on that point must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes [[/damage 3d8 cold]] damage and becomes stuck in the ice, reducing their movement speed by 10 feet until the start of your next turn. On a success, the target takes half as much damage and is not stuck in ice.</p>\n<p>The ground in the area is covered with slick ice and snow, making it difficult terrain until the start of your next turn.</p>\n<p><strong>At Higher Levels.</strong> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage increases by [[/r 1d8]] for each slot level above 2nd.</p>\n<p>\_</p>"

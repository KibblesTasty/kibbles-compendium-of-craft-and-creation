      <p>You use arcane power to briefly bring to power or modify your
      inventions. For the duration, you gain the effects of one unrestricted
      upgrade. All normal prerequisite apply (including subclass and level
      requirements). The creation is magical, held together and formed of magic
      and spare parts, taking the form of the upgrade or empowering an existing
      upgrade with temporary new features. Casting this spell again ends the
      effects of any previous castings of this spell.</p>

      <p><em><strong>At Higher Levels. </strong></em>When you cast this spell
      with a 3rd-level spell slot or higher, you can infuse the effects of an
      upgrade that requires 5th level or higher. When you cast this spell using
      a spell slot of 4th level or higher, you can infuse the effects of an
      upgrade that requires 9th level or higher. When you cast this spell with a
      5th-level spell slot or higher, you can infuse the effects of an upgrade
      that requires 11th level or higher.</p>

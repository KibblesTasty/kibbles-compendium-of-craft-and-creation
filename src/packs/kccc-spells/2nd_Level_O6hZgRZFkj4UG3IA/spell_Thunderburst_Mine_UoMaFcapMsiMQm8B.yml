      <p>You can set a magical trap by infusing explosive magic into an item.
      You can set this item to detonate when someone comes within 5 feet of it,
      or by a verbal command using your reaction (one or more mines can be
      detonated).</p>

      <p>When the magic trap detonates, each creature in a 10-foot-radius sphere
      centered on the item must make a Constitution saving throw. A creature
      takes 3d8 thunder damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a
      successful one. If a creature is in the area of effect of more than one
      thunderburst mine during a turn, they take half damage from any mines
      beyond the first.</p>

      <p>A magical mine must be set 5 feet or more from another mine, and can’t
      be moved once placed; any attempt to move it results in it detonating
      unless the casterer that set it disarms it with an action.</p>

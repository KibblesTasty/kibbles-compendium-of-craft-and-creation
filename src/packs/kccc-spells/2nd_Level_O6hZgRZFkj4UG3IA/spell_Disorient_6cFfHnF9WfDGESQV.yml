      <p>Targeting a creature with you can see, you flip their perception of
      reality. The target creature must pass a Wisdom saving throw or become
      disoriented. A disoriented creature has disadvantage on all attack rolls
      and at the start of their turn moves 10 feet (up to its speed) in a random
      direction before their speed becomes zero until the start of their next
      turn.</p>

      <p>At the end of each of its turns, the target can make another Wisdom
      saving throw. On a success, the spell ends, but if the target fails by 5
      or more, it fails prone.</p>

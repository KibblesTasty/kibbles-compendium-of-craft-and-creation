      <p>You bring a Tiny object to life. Its Constitution is 10 and its
      Intelligence and Wisdom are 3, and its Charisma is 1. Its speed is 30
      feet; if the object lacks legs or other appendages it can use for
      locomotion, it instead has a flying speed of 30 feet and can hover. The
      object has the following stats: HP: 20, AC: 18, Str: 4, Dex: 18. The
      object has an attack modifier equal to your spell attack modifier. If the
      object is not a weapon, it deals 1d4 + your Spellcasting modifier damage
      on hit. Select from bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage based on the
      nature of the item. If the object is a weapon, it deals the weapon's
      damage dice + your Spellcasting modifier of the weapon's damage type. The
      spell can only animate one-handed weapons without the special modifier
      this way.</p>

      <p>As a bonus action, you can mentally command the animated object as long
      as it is within 60 feet of you. You decide what action the creature will
      take and where it will move during its next turn, or you can issue a
      general command, such as to guard a particular chamber or corridor. If you
      issue no commands, the creature only defends itself against hostile
      creatures. Once given an order, the creature continues to follow it until
      its task is complete.</p>

      <p>If the object is securely attached to a surface or a larger object,
      such as a chain bolted to a wall, its speed is 0. It has blindsight with a
      radius of 30 feet and is blind beyond that distance. When the animated
      object drops to 0 hit points, it reverts to its original object form, and
      any remaining damage carries over to its original object form.</p>

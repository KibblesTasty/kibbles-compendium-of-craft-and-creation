    value: >-
      <p>You draw an ethereal mark in the air at a point within range. Creatures
      within 10 feet of this glyph have resistance to all damage, but when any
      creature in the runeâ€™s radius takes damage, the rune takes an equal
      amount. The glyph has 10 hit points. If the glyph is destroyed, it fades
      without detonating and the spell ends.</p><p>As an action, you can
      detonate the glyph. Any creature within 15 feet of this glyph must make a
      Dexterity saving throw, or take force damage equal to half the amount of
      damage the glyph has absorbed. After using this action, the spell
      ends.</p><p>You can end the spell early by deactivating it with a bonus
      action.</p><p><em><strong>At Higher Levels. </strong></em>When you cast
      this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the glyph's hit
      points increas by 5 for each slot level above 1st.</p><p></p>

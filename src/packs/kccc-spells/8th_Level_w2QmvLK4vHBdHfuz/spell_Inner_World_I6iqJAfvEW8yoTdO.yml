    value: >-
      <p>As an action, you create and enter an imaginary world. All other
      creatures within 120 feet are pulled this world with you. This world is
      centered on you, and extends in 120 feet in all directions.</p>

      <p>A creature that reaches the edge of this world can make a Charisma
      saving throw to attempt to exit, spending 5 feet of movement to return
      where they were before being pulled into the world on success, and being
      unable to move out the world until the start of their next turn on
      failure. A creature outside the world can attempt to enter it by moving to
      where you cast the spell (which is marked by a glowing psionic rift) and
      making a Charisma saving throw to enter the world. You can allow a
      creature to automatically pass their save to enter or exit the world.</p>

      <p>When you create this world, you can create obstacles and terrain of
      your choice, creating walls, pillars, and other obstacles that take up to
      twenty 5 by 5 square foot areas (stylistically, these can appear however
      you choose). These can be placed consecutively or spread out in any method
      of your choosing, but any area with a creature must contain a path that
      creature can fit through to both you and the edge of the of the world.</p>

      <p>You can additionally create up to five hazardous spaces on the ground
      that are 5 foot squares. These can be fires, spikes, biting mouthes, or
      whatever you choose, but regardless of its form if a creature takes [[/r
      4d4 + 4]] psychic damage when it enters the effect's area for the first
      time on a turn or starts its turn there. Each of these hazards must be at
      least 20 feet from another hazard.</p>

      <p>While in this inner world, if you fail saving throw, you choose to
      succeed instead. You can do up to 3 times during the duration of the
      spell. All spells and powers have their psi point cost reduced by one.</p>

      <p>During the spell, as an action, you can attempt to destroy a creature
      within the world. The target must make an Intelligence saving throw. On
      failure, it takes [[/r 8d8 + 8]] psychic damage and is removed from the
      imaginary world, returning to where they were before being pulled into
      it.</p>

      <p>The world can be brightly or dimly lit, and you control the weather
      within it.</p>

      <p>When the spell ends, you and any creature that remains in the world
      exit the world returning to space you entered the world from.</p>

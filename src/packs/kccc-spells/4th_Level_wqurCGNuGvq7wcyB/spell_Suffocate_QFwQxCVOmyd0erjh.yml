    value: >-
      <p>You create a whirling sphere of air around a creature that causes them
      to struggle to breathe. The target must make a Constitution saving throw.
      On a failure, the target loses [[/r 5d8]] hit points due to lack of air,
      has disadvantage on all ability checks, and cannot speak. On a success,
      the target takes half as much damage and suffers no other effects. For the
      duration, as an action, you can force the creation to make a saving throw
      against the ability again.</p>

      <p>If a target fails their saving throw against this spell 3 times in a
      row, they become incapacitated until they succeed on a save or the spell
      ends. If you don’t use your action to force the target to make a save, it
      counts as a success.</p>

      <p>A creature that does not need to breathe is unaffected by this
      spell.</p>

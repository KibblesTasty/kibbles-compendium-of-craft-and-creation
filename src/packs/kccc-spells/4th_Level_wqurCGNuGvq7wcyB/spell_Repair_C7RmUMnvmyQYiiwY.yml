    value: >-
      <p>You touch a construct or inanimate object, causing it to regain [[/r
      10d6]] hit points. This causes any parts or material that has broken away
      from the construct or object to reattach, repairing it to the condition it
      was in before losing those hit points.</p>

      <p>If the construct or object's damaged state is the result of age, you
      can instead repair to the condition it was in [[/r 10d6]] years ago, if it
      was previously in a better condition during that time (the condition can
      only improve or not change).</p>

      <p><em><strong>At Higher Levels.</strong></em> The hit points restored
      increases by [[/r 2d6]] (or the years restored) for each slot above
      4th.</p>

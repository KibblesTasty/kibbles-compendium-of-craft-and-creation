      style="box-sizing:border-box;user-select:text;color:#191813;font-size:13px">When
      you learn or experience something, you can fix that memory, making it a
      permanent memory you can always remember with crystal clarity. This memory
      can be anything that occurs within a 1 hour span (it can be as short as a
      fleeting sensation, or as long as 1 hour of events).</p>

      <p
      style="box-sizing:border-box;user-select:text;color:#191813;font-size:13px">Once
      you do this, you can’t do so again until you finish a long rest. Absorbing
      these memories is how a Farling ages, and you age one day for each memory
      you absorb in this way. You can absorb a memory from a willing creature
      via your telepathy in this way.</p>

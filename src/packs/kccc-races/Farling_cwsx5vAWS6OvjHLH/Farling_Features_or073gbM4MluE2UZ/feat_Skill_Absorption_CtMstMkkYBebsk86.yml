      <p>Your rapid ability to learn new skills grants you proficiency in one
      artisan tool and one skill of your choice. At your GM’s discretion, if
      your game allows for the training in tools and skills, you may gain
      proficiency in them twice as fast using your Crystalized Memory feature
      daily.</p>

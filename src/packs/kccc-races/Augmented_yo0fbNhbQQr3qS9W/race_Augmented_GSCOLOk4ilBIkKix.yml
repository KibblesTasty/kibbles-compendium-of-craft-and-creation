    value: "<p>Almost all augmented are intentionally created—not always by the intentions of the individual, but almost always by the intention of someone. This often leaves open the question of why, and for what purpose.</p><p>Many of them are created for war, some as bizare experiments, some to restore missing pieces, sometimes they had a choice in the process, and some will insist that they never asked for it.</p><p>@Embed[Compendium.kibbles-compendium-of-craft-and-creation.kccc-roll-tables.RollTable.OzgEOSqJJpwCQuRP]</p><h2>Traits</h2><p>As an augmented, the following traits replace any traits that your race would normally grant you:</p><p><strong>Modified Origin. </strong>Select an existing race option. You gain the creature type, size, and languages of that race.</p><p><strong>Ability Score Increase.\_</strong> Your Constitution score increases by 1, and one ability score of your choice increases by 1.</p><p><strong>Alignment.</strong> An augmented creature can be any alignment, but have a inclination toward lawful alignments.</p><p><strong>Speed.</strong> Your base walking speed is 30 feet.</p><p><strong>Inherited Abilities.</strong> You can keep the following elements of that race: any skill proficiencies you gained from it and any climbing, flying, or swimming speed you gained from it. Alternatively, you can forgo this to select one additional option from Augmented Abilities (below).</p><p><strong>Augmented Abilites</strong>. On top of your inherited abilties, you have been augmented with one of the following, granting you special new abilities:</p><p><strong>Arcane Arm.</strong> Your arm is replaced by a mechanical or magical replacement. Your Strength score increases by 1, and it can serve as a natural weapon. It deals 1d6 bludgeoning damage on hit, and counts as a simple weapon with the light property. @Compendium[kibbles-compendium-of-craft-and-creation.kccc-races.hUJuU6RNHKVvBvcY]{Augmented: Arcane Arm}</p><p><strong>Arcane Eye.</strong> Your eye (one or both) are replaced by mechanical or magical replacements. You can see in dim light within 120 feet of you as if it were bright light and in darkness as if it were dim light. You discern colors in that darkness as shades of gray, and gain proficiency in the Perception skill. You can cast the detect magic spell, and once you reach 5th level, the see invisible spell with this eye. Casting them in this way requires no material components. Once you cast either of these spells with this trait, you can’t cast that spell with it again until you finish a long rest. You can also cast these spells using any spell slots you have. @Compendium[kibbles-compendium-of-craft-and-creation.kccc-races.GtMz4qxbasnokCrF]{Augmented: Arcane Eye}</p><p><strong>Arcane Heart.</strong> Your heart (or equivalient organ) is replaced by a mechanical or magical replacement. Your Constitution score increases by 1, and whenever you roll Hit Dice, you gain temporary hit points equal to the number of Hit Dice expended. @Compendium[kibbles-compendium-of-craft-and-creation.kccc-races.icAtFN9gdestPpzt]{Augmented: Arcane Heart}</p><p><strong>Arcane Mind.</strong> Your mind is enhanced by mechanical or magical minds. Your Intelligence score increases by 1, and you gain advantage on any Intelligence check to recall information you’ve seen before, solve mathematical equations, detect patterns, or break ciphers and codes. @Compendium[kibbles-compendium-of-craft-and-creation.kccc-races.1ZUTL21oFDVmT7eg]{Augmented: Arcane Mind}</p>"

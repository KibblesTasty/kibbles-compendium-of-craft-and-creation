      <p>The warped are members of races that have been deeply influenced by the
      powers from beyond, twisting their mind and body with mysterious power
      that has left them fundamentally changed.</p><h2>Twisted
      Origin</h2><p>Most often this comes from long exposure, sometimes only
      manifesting in creatures born under its influence, but there are those
      that have been warped later in life, generally by more direct interactions
      with the creatures that lurk beyond the veil of sanity.</p><p>Many of the
      warped fall to madness, unable to escape the whispering voices and strange
      visions, but ones that become adventurers have managed to learn to live
      with their condition, and consequently have minds of
      steel.</p><p>@Embed[Compendium.kibbles-compendium-of-craft-and-creation.kccc-roll-tables.RollTable.7hXLbW8lyvZJMafM]</p><h2>Traits</h2><p><strong>Warped
      Origin.</strong> Select an existing race option. You gain the creature
      type, size, and languages of that race.</p><p><strong>Whispers of Madness.
      </strong>You have learned to understanding the whispering voices you hear.
      You learn Deep Speech.</p><p><strong>Ability Score Increase.</strong> Your
      Constitution score increases by 1, and your Intelligence score increases
      by 2.</p><p><strong>Aligmment.</strong> An warped creature can be any
      alignment, but have a inclination toward chaotic
      alignments.</p><p><strong>Speed. </strong>Your base walking speed is 30
      feet.</p><p><strong>Inured of Madness.</strong> Things that cause madness
      in others seem relatively benign to you. You have resistance to psychic
      damage. You automatically pass any saves against madness.
      @Compendium[kibbles-compendium-of-craft-and-creation.kccc-races.6wmcsPOmUGZyxkbM]{Warped:
      Inured of Madness}</p><p><strong>Inner Voice.</strong> You have an inner
      voice that doesn’t belong to you, frequently muttering nonsense, but
      occasionally offering useful advice, letting you add 1d6 to any ability
      check you make. You can do this a number of times equal to your
      proficiency bonus, regaining all uses at the end of a long rest.
      @Compendium[kibbles-compendium-of-craft-and-creation.kccc-races.TAhXWR5Y1whhbpcv]{Warped:
      Inner Voice}</p><p><strong>Warped Gift. </strong>Your condition grants you
      one special trait. Some may view it as a curse or burden, but you’ve
      adapted to using it to your advantage. Select one of the following
      options:</p><ul><li><strong>Warped Eyes.</strong> You see the world in a
      different way. You have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks against
      living creatures, and disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks against
      non-living things (such as traps or details in your environment).
      @Compendium[kibbles-compendium-of-craft-and-creation.kccc-races.jdLoKrSYbUvOBKRF]{Warped
      Gift: Warped Eye}</li><li><strong>Warped Limb.</strong> One of your limbs
      is abnormally long and flexible. Any weapon wielded in that hand gains the
      reach property.
      @Compendium[kibbles-compendium-of-craft-and-creation.kccc-races.8mYeWYcohO8SCPuq]{Warped
      Gift: Warped Limb}</li><li><strong>Warped Mind. </strong>Your mind is a
      foreign and alien place compared to other humanoids. You are immune to
      magic that allows other creatures to read your thoughts, determine whether
      you are lying, know your alignment, or know your creature type. Creatures
      can telepathically communicate with you only if you allow it.
      @Compendium[kibbles-compendium-of-craft-and-creation.kccc-races.sBsW38s0ocfNFICu]{Warped
      Gift: Warped Mind}</li><li><strong>Warped Skin.</strong> Your skin is a
      rough mottled hide. You have resistance to acid damage.
      @Compendium[kibbles-compendium-of-craft-and-creation.kccc-races.cZryr9maEVNq3P2D]{Warped
      Gift: Warped Skin}</li><li><strong>Warped Form.</strong> Your body is more
      malleable and flexible than a normal humanoid. You can move through spaces
      for a smaller creatures without squeezing and when you aren’t wearing
      armor, your AC is 12 + your Constitution modifier. You can use your
      natural armor to determine your AC if the armor you wear would leave you
      with a lower AC. A shield’s benefits apply as normal while you use your
      natural armor.

    value: "<p>The warped are members of races that have been deeply influenced by the powers from beyond, twisting their mind and body with mysterious power that has left them fundamentally changed.</p>\n<h2>Twisted Origin</h2>\n<p>Most often this comes from long exposure, sometimes only manifesting in creatures born under its influence, but there are those that have been warped later in life, generally by more direct interactions with the creatures that lurk beyond the veil of sanity.</p>\n<p>Many of the warped fall to madness, unable to escape the whispering voices and strange visions, but ones that become adventurers have managed to learn to live with their condition, and consequently have minds of steel.</p>\n<h3><strong>Quirks</strong></h3>\n<table style=\"width:100%;height:79px\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"height:16px\">\n<td style=\"width:21.6011%;height:16px;text-align:center\"><strong>d4</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width:78.3989%;height:16px;text-align:center\"><strong>Quirks</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:16px\">\n<td style=\"width:21.6011%;height:16px;text-align:center\">1</td>\n<td style=\"width:78.3989%;height:16px;text-align:center\">You hide your warped nature under wrappings.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:16px\">\n<td style=\"width:21.6011%;height:16px;text-align:center\">2</td>\n<td style=\"width:78.3989%;height:16px;text-align:center\">You like to show off your enhanced abilities.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:15px\">\n<td style=\"width:21.6011%;height:15px;text-align:center\">3</td>\n<td style=\"width:78.3989%;height:15px;text-align:center\">Your eyes and hair are unnatural colors.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:16px\">\n<td style=\"width:21.6011%;height:16px;text-align:center\">4</td>\n<td style=\"width:78.3989%;height:16px;text-align:center\">You mutter to yourself frequently.</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>\_</p>\n<h2>Traits</h2>\n<p><strong>Warped Origin.</strong> Select an existing race option. You gain the creature type, size, and languages of that race.</p>\n<p><strong>Whispers of Madness. </strong>You have learned to understanding the whispering voices you hear. You learn Deep Speech.</p>\n<p><strong>Ability Score Increase.</strong> Your Constitution score increases by 1, and your Intelligence score increases by 2.</p>\n<p><strong>Aligmment.</strong> An warped creature can be any alignment, but have a inclination toward chaotic alignments.</p>\n<p><strong>Speed. </strong>Your base walking speed is 30 feet.</p>\n<p><strong>Inured of Madness.</strong> Things that cause madness in others seem relatively benign to you. You have resistance to psychic damage. You automatically pass any saves against madness. @Compendium[kibbles-compendium-of-craft-and-creation.kccc-races.6wmcsPOmUGZyxkbM]{Warped: Inured of Madness}</p>\n<p><strong>Inner Voice.</strong> You have an inner voice that doesn’t belong to you, frequently muttering nonsense, but occasionally offering useful advice, letting you add 1d6 to any ability check you make. You can do this a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, regaining all uses at the end of a long rest. @Compendium[kibbles-compendium-of-craft-and-creation.kccc-races.TAhXWR5Y1whhbpcv]{Warped: Inner Voice}</p>\n<p><strong>Warped Gift. </strong>Your condition grants you one special trait. Some may view it as a curse or burden, but you’ve adapted to using it to your advantage. Select one of the following options:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Warped Eyes.</strong> You see the world in a different way. You have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks against living creatures, and disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks against non-living things (such as traps or details in your environment). @Compendium[kibbles-compendium-of-craft-and-creation.kccc-races.jdLoKrSYbUvOBKRF]{Warped Gift: Warped Eye}</li>\n<li><strong>Warped Limb.</strong> One of your limbs is abnormally long and flexible. Any weapon wielded in that hand gains the reach property. @Compendium[kibbles-compendium-of-craft-and-creation.kccc-races.8mYeWYcohO8SCPuq]{Warped Gift: Warped Limb}</li>\n<li><strong>Warped Mind. </strong>Your mind is a foreign and alien place compared to other humanoids. You are immune to magic that allows other creatures to read your thoughts, determine whether you are lying, know your alignment, or know your creature type. Creatures can telepathically communicate with you only if you allow it. @Compendium[kibbles-compendium-of-craft-and-creation.kccc-races.sBsW38s0ocfNFICu]{Warped Gift: Warped Mind}</li>\n<li><strong>Warped Skin.</strong> Your skin is a rough mottled hide. You have resistance to acid damage. @Compendium[kibbles-compendium-of-craft-and-creation.kccc-races.cZryr9maEVNq3P2D]{Warped Gift: Warped Skin}</li>\n<li><strong>Warped Form.</strong> Your body is more malleable and flexible than a normal humanoid. You can move through spaces for a smaller creatures without squeezing and when you aren’t wearing armor, your AC is 12 + your Constitution modifier. You can use your natural armor to determine your AC if the armor you wear would leave you with a lower AC. A shield’s benefits apply as normal while you use your natural armor. @Compendium[kibbles-compendium-of-craft-and-creation.kccc-races.h3LCIiH4MBiJxRi3]{Warped Gift: Warped Form}</li>\n</ul>"

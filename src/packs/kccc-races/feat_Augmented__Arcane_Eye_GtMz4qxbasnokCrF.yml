      <p>Your eye (one or both) are replaced by mechanical or magical
      replacements. You can see in dim light within 120 feet of you as if it
      were bright light and in darkness as if it were dim light. You discern
      colors in that darkness as shades of gray, and gain proficiency in the
      Perception skill. You can cast the detect magic spell, and once you reach
      5th level, the see invisible spell with this eye. Casting them in this way
      requires no material components. Once you cast either of these spells with
      this trait, you canâ€™t cast that spell with it again until you finish a
      long rest. You can also cast these spells using any spell slots you
      have.</p>

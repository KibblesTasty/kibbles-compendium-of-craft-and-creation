    value: >-
      <p>Your body is more malleable and flexible than a normal humanoid. You
      can move through spaces for a smaller creatures without squeezing and when
      you aren’t wearing armor, your AC is 12 + your Constitution modifier. You
      can use your natural armor to determine your AC if the armor you wear
      would leave you with a lower AC. A shield’s benefits apply as normal while
      you use your natural armor.</p>

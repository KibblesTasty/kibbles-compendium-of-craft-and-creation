    value: >-
      <p>Your mind is a foreign and alien place compared to other humanoids. You
      are immune to magic that allows other creatures to read your thoughts,
      determine whether you are lying, know your alignment, or know your
      creature type. Creatures can telepathically communicate with you only if
      you allow it.</p>

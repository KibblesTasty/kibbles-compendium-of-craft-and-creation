    value: "<p>The origins of Ironwrought are many and varied. They can be the artisanal masterpiece of a Golemsmith, or perhaps a relic of a mass production of an ancient lost civilization... or perhaps not-so-lost a civilization. Their source and purpose will vary greatly. Were they made with sapience in mind, or did they gain it later? Were they made for labor or war?</p>\n<p>Some Ironwrought will dwell on these questions and what it means for them to exist outside of the boundary of their original purpose, but many simply move on, acquiring new parameters to live their life from those they interact with, finding their purpose in life as any of their more fleshy counterparts might.</p>\n<p>How they are treated in society will vary based on how common they are. In settings where Ironwrought created for labor are common, they will generally be treated quite neutrally, while they may be treated with greater fear or concern if Ironwrought were primarily created as war machines, though in both cases they might be mistaken for their last sapient cousins.</p>\n<p>\_</p>\n<h2>Self Aware</h2>\n<p>While most constructs are not truly self aware, an Ironwrought is a special case of a cosntruct that has attained a full degree of self-awareness... sometimes in a more rudimentary way, sometimes as self-aware as any human. How that occurred is often dependent on your origin. Here is a table of some origins of your self-awareness. You can roll on the following table, pick one that suits your character, or select a different reason entirely based on your game’s setting and character’s backstory.</p>\n<h3><strong>Origin of Sapience</strong></h3>\n<table style=\"width:100%\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:center;width:15.892%\"><strong>d8</strong></td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center;width:84.108%\"><strong>Origin</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:center;width:15.892%\">1</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center;width:84.108%\">You existed without self awareness for years before a magical accident rendered you self aware.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:center;width:15.892%\">2</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center;width:84.108%\">You were a new experiment, designed for more complicated tasks, and ended up more sapient than expected.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:center;width:15.892%\">3</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center;width:84.108%\">Left to a mindless task for hundreds of years in a long abandoned location, you slowly developed a sense of self until you abandoned your programmed task.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:center;width:15.892%\">4</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center;width:84.108%\">Your sapience is the result of the influence of a supernatural being (celestial, fey, or even fiend) granting you self-awareness for their purposes (or entertainment).</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:center;width:15.892%\">5</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center;width:84.108%\">You awoke from a long hibernation changed, with greater self awareness. You don’t remember the past.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:center;width:15.892%\">6</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center;width:84.108%\">The Inventor that created you intentionally granted you full sapience, trying to build a child, friend, or adventuring companion.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:center;width:15.892%\">7</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center;width:84.108%\">You are the consciousness of a mortal imbued into a metal shell, transferred to a Construct to save your life.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:center;width:15.892%\">8</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center;width:84.108%\">You are the inventor that created yourself, transferring your consciousness to the Construct for reasons of your own.</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h2>Personality</h2>\n<p>The personality of Ironwrought can vary greatly as their origins can vary greatly. In some cases they are humanoids that have been bound to an Ironwrought, melancholy about their new metalbound existence. Other times they have a pragmatic nature unconcerned with the unknowable trivialities, focused on the here and now. Ironwrought most frequently have pragmatic personalities that are inclined to logical outcomes. While as a sapient creature they are capable of understanding emotion, they may not fully experience it, or not let it affect them to the degree of the more easily influenced fleshy fellows.</p>\n<h3><strong>Quirks</strong></h3>\n<table style=\"width:100%\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width:18.3734%;text-align:center\"><strong>d6</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width:81.6266%;text-align:center\"><strong>Quirks</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width:18.3734%;text-align:center\">1</td>\n<td style=\"width:81.6266%;text-align:center\">You provide one detail too many in any conversation.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width:18.3734%;text-align:center\">2</td>\n<td style=\"width:81.6266%;text-align:center\">You feel pity for fleshy creatures with their fleeting life spans.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width:18.3734%;text-align:center\">3</td>\n<td style=\"width:81.6266%;text-align:center\">You are inherently rational, and can be persuaded of anything with appropriate logic.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width:18.3734%;text-align:center\">4</td>\n<td style=\"width:81.6266%;text-align:center\">You have a programmed code of conduct that you will never violate. You may or may not be aware of it.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width:18.3734%;text-align:center\">5</td>\n<td style=\"width:81.6266%;text-align:center\">A vestige of a previously set task occasionally surfaces, compelling you to perform a strange action, such as sweeping a floor clean.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width:18.3734%;text-align:center\">6</td>\n<td style=\"width:81.6266%;text-align:center\">You have some fragments of the memories of another creature, perhaps a past version of yourself, in your mind.</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h2>Ironwrought Names</h2>\n<p>Your name can be virtually anything. Many Ironwrought have no real name, often having either acquired a nickname before or after gaining sapience.

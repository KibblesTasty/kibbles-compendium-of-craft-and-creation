      <p>Beginning at 7th level, you can save against effects that allow you to
      save at the end of your turn at the start of your turn instead.</p>

      <p>Starting at 18th level, you can use your reaction to extend this
      benefit to another creature you can see within 30 feet that starts their
      turn under an effect they can save against at the end of their turn.</p>

      <p>A turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from
      you as it can, and it can’t willingly move to a space within 30 feet of
      you. It also can’t take reactions. For its action, it can use only the
      Dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving.
      If there’s nowhere to move, the creature can use the Dodge
      action.</p><p>If the creature’s true form is concealed by an illusion,
      shapeshifting, or other effect, that form is revealed while it is
      turned.</p>

      <p>As an action, you can make any aberration or undead, provided that it’s
      within 30 feet and that can see or hear you, make a Wisdom saving throw.
      If the creature fails its saving throw, it is turned for 1 minute or until
      it takes damage. A turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as
      far away from you as it can, and it can’t willingly move to a space within
      30 feet of you. It also can’t take reactions. For its action, it can use
      only the Dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from
      moving. If there’s nowhere to move, the creature can use the Dodge
      action.</p><p>If the creature’s true form is concealed by an illusion,

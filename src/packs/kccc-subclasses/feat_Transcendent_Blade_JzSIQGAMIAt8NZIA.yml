    value: >-
      <p>Starting at 17th level, your Soul Blade becomes a peerless weapon. You
      can add a +1 to its attack and damage rolls. You can choose for your blade
      to affect inanimate material, causing it to gain the Siege property and
      deal force damage to it when you choose. Reactions that parry or block to
      add Armor Class against an attack are ineffective against attacks made
      with the Soul Blade.</p>

      <p>Additionally, critical hits from your Soul Blade rend the soul of the
      target. If a creature would have less than 50 hit points after taking
      damage from your critical strike, the creature must make a Charisma saving
      throw. On failure, its Charisma score becomes zero and it dies.</p>

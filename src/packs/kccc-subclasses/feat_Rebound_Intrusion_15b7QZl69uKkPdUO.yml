      <p>Starting at 10th level, if a creature attempts to read your mind, you
      can make a Wisdom saving throw against the effect even if it would
      normally not allow a save. If it would normally allow a save, you have
      advantage on the save. If you succeed the save, you can instead read their
      mind, as if by the detect thoughts spell (this effect doesnâ€™t require
      concentration, but lasts only until the end of your next turn, and targets
      only the creature that attempted to read your mind).</p>

      <p>Additionally, you gain resistance to psychic damage, and when a
      creature deals psychic damage to you, it takes an equal amount of psychic
      damage.</p>

      <p>Starting at 10th level, as a bonus action you can cause your
      Contraption to record your existence. Record your hit points, location,
      and any conditions you are affected by. At the start of your next turn,
      your current hit points, location, and conditions are returned to the
      saved state in a flash of light. If you die while having your save state,
      you can make a [[/save cha dc=15]] saving throw (making the check as if
      you were alive) when the start of your next turn would have been. On
      success, you return as normal. On failure, you remain dead.</p><p>Once you
      use this, you can’t use this again until you finish a long rest.</p>

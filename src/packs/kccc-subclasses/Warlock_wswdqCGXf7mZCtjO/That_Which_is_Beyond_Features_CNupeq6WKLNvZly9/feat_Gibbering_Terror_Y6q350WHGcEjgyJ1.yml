  description:
    value: >-
      <p>Starting at 6th level, when you use the Telepathic Intrusion power, you
      always add the Terrifying modifier, causing the target to be frightened of
      you until the end of your next turn if it fails its saving throw.</p>

      <p>When they fail the saving throw by 5 or more, they additionally lose
      the ability to speak while frightened in this way, gibbering in fear in
      confusion.</p>

      <p>Starting at 14th level, you gain enough mental control to form the
      twisted nightmares that dwell within your mind into the world. As an
      action, targeting a point within 60 feet you spawn a malignant
      otherworldly nightmare, taking the form of a twisted aberration of
      terror.</p>

      <p>The first time a creature other than you is within 20 feet of it during
      their turn (including starting their turn there), they must make a Wisdom
      saving throw. On failure they take 4d8 psychic damage and become
      frightened of it.</p>

      <p>The spawned nightmare lasts until the start of your turn, when it fades
      away unless at least one creature has failed their saving throw against
      its effect, in which case it persists for another round (indefinitely
      until no creatures fail their saving throw against it, after which it
      fades away at the start of your next turn).</p>

      <p>Once you use this ability, you can’t do so until you finish a short or
      long rest.</p>

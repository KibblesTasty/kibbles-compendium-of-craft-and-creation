      <p>Additionally at 11th level, you gain the ability to fire special shots
      with a range of 30 feet that carry a cord that immediately pulls to that
      location. As an action or attack as part of the Attack action, you can
      make this shot against a creature, surface, or object. This shot does no
      damage, but on a hit, if the creature or object is Small or smaller, it is
      immediately pulled up to 30 feet toward you. If the creature is Medium or
      larger you are pulled 30 feet toward it.</p>

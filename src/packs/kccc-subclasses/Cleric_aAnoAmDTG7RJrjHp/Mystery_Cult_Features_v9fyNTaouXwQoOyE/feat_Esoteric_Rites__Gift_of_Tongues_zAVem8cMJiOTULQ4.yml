      <p>You learn Deep Speech. If you already know Deep Speech, you gain one
      additional language of your choice. You can use this esoteric language as
      your verbal components, and creatures can no longer successfully identify
      a spell you are casting.</p>

      <p>Spell casting checks to interfere with your magic are made with
      disadvantage (such as counterspell), and must make a check even if they
      would normally automatically succeed.</p>

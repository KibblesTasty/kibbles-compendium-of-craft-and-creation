      <p>Starting when you choose this domain at 1st level, you can communicate
      telepathically with any creature you can see within 30 feet of you, and
      they can reply in kind. You donâ€™t need to share a language with the
      creature for it to understand your telepathic utterances, but the creature
      must be able to understand at least one language.</p>

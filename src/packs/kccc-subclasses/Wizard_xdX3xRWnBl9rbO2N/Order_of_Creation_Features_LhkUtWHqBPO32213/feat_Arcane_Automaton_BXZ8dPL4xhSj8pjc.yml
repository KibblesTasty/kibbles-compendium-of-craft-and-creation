      <p>Starting at 2nd level, you apply your skills of magic and creation to
      forge a small mechanical helper. The
      @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.JGT5bNqu9REL7Fuz]{find familiar} spell
      is added to your spellbook. (If its there already add another 1st level
      Wizard spell of your choosing) Its material component becomes tinker’s
      tools (they are not consumed on casting), and when you summon it gains the
      traits for the creature selected, as well as the following additional
      traits:</p><ul><li>Its type becomes construct.</li><li>It acts on your
      turn.</li><li>It gains temporary hit points when summoned or at the end of
      a long rest equal to your Intelligence modifier + your wizard
      level.</li><li>As long as it is within 30 feet of you, you can cast spells
      as if you were in its position.</li><li>Select three wizard cantrips you
      can cast. Your familiar can cast these cantrips, casting them (in total) a
      number of times equal to your proficiency bonus (casting them as a 1st
      level caster). It uses your spellcasting ability modifier when casting
      these spells. It regains all uses when you finish a long rest.</li></ul>

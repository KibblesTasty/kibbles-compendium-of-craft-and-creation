      <p>Starting at 10th level, your Arcane Automaton gains proficiency in two
      skills of your choice and can activate spells imbued in Arcane Gadgets
      without making an Intelligence (Arcana) check as long as the spell doesnâ€™t
      require concentration. You can change what skills your familiar is
      proficient in when you summon it with <em>find familiar</em> again.</p>

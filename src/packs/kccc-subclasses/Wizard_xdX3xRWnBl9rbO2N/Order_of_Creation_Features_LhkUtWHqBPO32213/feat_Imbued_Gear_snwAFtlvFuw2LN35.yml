You can cast this spell once without expending a spell slot, regaining the ability to cast it again when you finish a long rest.</p>\n<p>If the spell targets only you, has a duration of more than 10 minutes, and doesnâ€™t require concentration, it lasts until you finish a long rest instead of its normal duration.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<h3><strong>Extended Duration Spells</strong></h3>\n<p>The spells that fit this criteria for expanding their duration include include:</p>\n<p>1st level:<em> </em>false life, longstrider, mage armor</p>\n<p>2nd level: continual flame, darkvision</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\_</p>"

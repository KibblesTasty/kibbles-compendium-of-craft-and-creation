    value: >-
      <p>Beginning when you select this school at 2nd level, you delve into the
      systematic study of psionics, select one Psionic Discipline from the Psion
      class to begin your studies with.</p>

      <p>The psionic power of the Discipline becomes a 1st-level spell for you.
      When you cast it using a spell slot, you cast it as if expending psi
      points equal to the spell slot level spent (for example, when casting as a
      1st-level spell, you cast it as if empowering it with 1 psi point).</p>

      <p>When you begin the study of new Disciplines at 6th level, 10th level,
      and 14th level, you gain the Disciplines power as a 1st-level spell
      following the same rules.</p>

      <p>These psionic power spells are branded into your mind, and always
      prepared but do not count against your spells prepared for the day.</p>

    value: >-
      <p>Additionally at 6th level, your understandings of the nature of
      psionics means you do not have disadvantage when attempting to use
      counterspell or dispel magic against psionic effects, and you gain
      proficiency with the Psionics skill (which functions similar to the Arcana
      skill, but applies to Psionic effects).</p>

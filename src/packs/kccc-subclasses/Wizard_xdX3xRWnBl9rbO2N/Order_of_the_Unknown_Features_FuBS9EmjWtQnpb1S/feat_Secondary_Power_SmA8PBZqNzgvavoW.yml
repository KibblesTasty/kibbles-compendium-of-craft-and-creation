    value: >-
      <p>Starting at 2nd level, the power of the psionics you study begins to
      seep into your mind, bleeding in from your studies of its
      mysteries.</p><p>This starts to poison your mind with a minor psionic
      madness from the table below, and you can tap this power to use one of
      your psionic power spells gained from the Study of the Unknown to cast it
      without expending a spell slot, but as if you had spent a spell slot equal
      to half your Wizard level (rounded up).</p><p>Once you do this, you canâ€™t
      do so again until you finish a long rest, or use your Arcane Recovery
      feature.</p><p>@Embed[Compendium.kibbles-compendium-of-craft-and-creation.kccc-roll-tables.RollTable.FWPn0jjhoM4wWWL3]</p>

      <p>Additionally at 10th level, the power of your mind strengthens
      transcending and its connection to your physical state. When you must make
      a Constitution or Death saving throw, you can replace it with an
      Intelligence saving throw. Once you do this you canâ€™t do so until you
      finish a short or long rest.</p>

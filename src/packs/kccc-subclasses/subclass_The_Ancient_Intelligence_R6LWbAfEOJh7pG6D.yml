    value: >-
      <p>You have made a pact of sorts with an intelligence that defies normal
      understanding; its aims are mysterious and often incomprehensible. This
      being could be an artificial intelligence of some lost race of ancients
      with fabulous technology, perhaps a high ranking mechanical overmind. They
      could even be an ancient lost rogue one, perhaps an Inventor of another
      era whose last act was to upload themselves in an incorporeal form, or
      perhaps it some-thing more alien, the ancient navigation system of an
      otherworldly ship that has gained sentience.</p><p>The possibilities are
      endless, but whatever its nature, it can grant you sufficiently advanced
      knowledge that for all intents and purposes is fabulous magical
      power.</p><hr /><p>The following are some optional quirks for a player who
      has formed a pact with an Ancient Intelligence You can optionally roll or
      select a quirk that suits your
      character.</p><p>@Embed[Compendium.kibbles-compendium-of-craft-and-creation.kccc-roll-tables.RollTable.4IQaEIVXgvKCcHKG]</p>

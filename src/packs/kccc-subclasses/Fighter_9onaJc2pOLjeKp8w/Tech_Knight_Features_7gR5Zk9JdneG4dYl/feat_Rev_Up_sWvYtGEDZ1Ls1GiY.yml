    value: >-
      <p>When hit an attack with your Brutal Invention, you can overcharge with
      an effect based on your Brutal Invention selection, granting it an
      additional benefit: </p><ul><li><p><strong>Reckless Power
      (Chainblade):</strong> The weapon’s damage dice become d6’s for that
      attack (including the special property if activated).
      </p></li><li><p><strong>Excessive Force (Ramming Gauntlet):</strong> The
      target is knocked 10 feet backwards.</p></li><li><p><strong>Full Auto
      (Repeating Hand Crossbow):</strong> You immediately make a single
      additional attack as part of the same action, making the attack with
      disadvantage; this disadvantage can’t be canceled out.
      </p></li><li><p><strong>Hypervelocity (Ricocheting Weapon):</strong> The
      weapon can target creatures within 20 feet of each other, and it can
      bounce to an additional target.</p></li><li><p><strong>Overcharge
      (Transforming Weapon):</strong> You deal an extra 2d4 lightning damage.
      </p></li></ul><p>You can use this ability a number of times equal to your
      Intelligence modifier (minimum 1), regaining all uses on a short or long
      rest.</p>

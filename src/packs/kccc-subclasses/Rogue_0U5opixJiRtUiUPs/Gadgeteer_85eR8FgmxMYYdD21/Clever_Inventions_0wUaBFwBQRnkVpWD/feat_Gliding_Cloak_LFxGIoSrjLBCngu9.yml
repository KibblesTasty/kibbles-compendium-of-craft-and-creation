    value: >-
      <p>You make a cloak that allows you to glide when falling. When you fall
      more than 10 feet and aren’t incapacitated, can spread this cloak to
      reduce your falling speed to 30 feet a round and take no falling damage.
      While falling in this manner toward the ground under normal gravity, you
      can move horizontally 2 feet for every 1 foot you descend.</p>

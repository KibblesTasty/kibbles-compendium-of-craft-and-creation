      <p>Starting at 3rd level, you’ve mastered both the creation and use of
      your most important gadget, the grappling hook. As an action or with the
      bonus action granted by your Cunning Action, you may target a surface,
      object or creature within 20 feet. If the target is Small or smaller, you
      can make a [[/check strength athletics]] check to pull it to you and
      grapple it (automatically succeeding against objects that are not being
      worn or carried unless the GM sets a difficulty for a particularly
      complicated scenario).</p><p>Alternatively, if the target is Medium or
      larger, you can choose to be pulled to it. This automatically succeeds,
      but this doesn’t grapple it, though if it is a surface or large object,
      you can choose to hold onto at the point you grappled if there is
      something to grab onto. Opportunity attacks provoked by this movement are
      made with disadvantage.</p>

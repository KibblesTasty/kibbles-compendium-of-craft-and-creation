  description:
    value: >-
      <p>The Path of the Raging Mind is a Barbarian that expresses their fury as
      a telekinetic manifestation. Their mind is so powerful that in their rage
      they warp the world around them. This is a psionic manifestation of a
      barbarian’s ability to focus their fury, and in battle this fury is
      weaponized as a deadly force that can fling about weapons and enemies
      alike.</p><p>They have to struggle with control... until they unleash
      themselves upon the battlefield, wreaking havoc on all that stands in
      their way.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Mental Strength</strong></p><p>This
      subclass often represents strength of mind, rather than raw brawn, but
      does not use Intelligence. This is because applications of your mental
      strength are generally via telekinesis, not academic application, and
      Strength continues to better mechanically represent how it functions.
      Consider if your character’s physical strength is more of a representation
      of their telekinetic abilities when using their Strength ability
      score.</p><p>Even prior to taking this path, perhaps the character’s
      strength came from the instinctive use of their telekinesis at short
      range, only learning to manifest it beyond the range of their touch as
      they take this path.</p><p>If you would like to play this as an
      Intelligence class, replacing all references to Strength with
      Intelligence, it doesn’t really break anything. Consult your
      GM.</p></blockquote>

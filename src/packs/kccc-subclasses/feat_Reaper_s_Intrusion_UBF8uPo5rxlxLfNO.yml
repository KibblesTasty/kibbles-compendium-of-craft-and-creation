      <p>Starting at 7th level, you gain the Telepathic Intrusion psionic power.
      You gain a number of psi points equal to your proficiency bonus, regaining
      them on a short or long rest. You can use these points to empower your
      Telepathic Intrusion or cast spells granted by the subclass, spending 1
      psi point per level of the spell in place of a spell slot.</p>

      <p>When you spend 1 or more psi points to empower it, you can use
      Telepathic Intrusion as a bonus action.</p>

      <h2><strong>Telepathic Intrusion</strong></h2>

      <p><em>Psionic power</em></p>

      <p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action</p>

      <p><strong>Range: </strong>60 feet</p>

      <p><strong>Components:</strong> S</p>

      <p><strong>Duration: </strong>Instantaneous</p>

      <p>You assault the mind of a creature you can see directly. The target
      must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC, or take
      1d8 psychic damage. If the target fails the saving throw, it has
      disadvantage on attacks made against you until the start of your next
      turn. You can choose to deal no damage to the creature when it fails its
      saving throw.</p>

      <p>The points must be spent when choosing the target of the power.</p>

      <p><strong>Rending (1+ psi points): </strong>The target takes 1d8 psychic
      damage for each additional point spent on a failed save.</p>

      <p><strong>Terrifying (1 psi point): </strong>The target is frightened of
      you until the end of your next turn if it fails its saving throw.</p>

      <p><strong>Meddling (2 psi points): </strong>You make one creature
      invisible to the target creature or cause the creature to see something
      that is not there with the effect of minor illusion until the start of
      your next turn if it fails its saving throw.</p>

      <p><strong>Overwhelming (3 psi points): </strong>The target is stunned
      until the end of its next turn if it fails its saving throw.</p>

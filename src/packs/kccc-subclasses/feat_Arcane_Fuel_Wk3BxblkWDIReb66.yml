      <p>At 14th level, you gain immunity to force damage. When you would take
      force damage, you regain health equal to half the damage you would have
      taken. You can gain a maximum amount of hit points this way equal to your
      sorcerer level, after which you no longer gain additional hit points until
      you finish a short or long rest.</p>

      <p>Additionally, you learn the spell dispel magic, or another sorcerer
      spell of your choice if you already know it. Dispel magic doesnâ€™t count
      against your spells known. When you successfully cast dispel magic or
      counterspell, you regain an expanded sorcery point (if you are not
      currently at your maximum) as you draw in the remnants of the broken
      magic.</p>

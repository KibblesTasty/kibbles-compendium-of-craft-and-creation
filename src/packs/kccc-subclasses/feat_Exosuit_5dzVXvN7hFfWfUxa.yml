    value: >-
      <p>Starting when you choose this path at 3rd level, you become bonded to
      the exosuit, though you need not necessarily always be wearing it. You are
      permanently connected to it in some way, and even if it is lost or
      destroyed, it recovers itself through its bond to you.</p>

      <p>In its dormant state, it has a small collapsed form, recedes into your
      body, or has no form at all (based on its nature). When you enter a rage,
      it is activated, becoming a complete suit of armor. It subsumes whatever
      armor you are wearing when it activates, adopting the AC of that armor (if
      you are not wearing armor, it has the AC of your Unarmored Defense). In
      addition, it grants you the following properties:</p>

      <ul>

      <li><strong>Regenerating Armor.</strong> Your exosuit protects you from
      blows, reducing the damage you take by your proficiency bonus.</li>

      <li><strong>Iron Fists.</strong> If you are not carrying anything in your
      hand, that hand is treated as a weapon that deals 1d8 bludgeoning damage
      with the light property.</li>

      <li><strong>Smashing Force.</strong> Whenever you succeed on an Athletics
      (Strength) check to shove or grapple a creature, you can deal 1d4 + your
      Strength modifier bludgeoning damage to the target creature.</li>

      </ul>

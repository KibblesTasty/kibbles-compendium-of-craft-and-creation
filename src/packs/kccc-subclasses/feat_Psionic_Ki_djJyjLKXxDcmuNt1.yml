      <p>Additionally at 3rd level, you gain the
      @UUID[Compendium.kibbles-compendium-of-craft-and-creation.kccc-classes.Item.3CunKcMvbfKwAORU]{Telekinetics
      Discipline}. You can use ki points as psi points, with a limit of 1 ki
      point. This limit increases to 2 ki points at level 5, 3 ki points at
      level 9, 4 ki points at level 13, and 5 ki points at level 17. The DC for
      your psionic abilities is equal to your ki save DC.</p><p>If your
      character has both psi points and ki points, those are added together into
      one pool and can be used interchangeably. Your psi limit (and the limit
      you can use ki points as psi points) becomes your psi limit + one third of
      your monk levels rounded down.</p><p>When you use your action on a psionic
      power or to cast a spell using this feature, you can make one attack with
      an unarmed strike or monk weapon as a bonus action before the end of your
      turn.</p>

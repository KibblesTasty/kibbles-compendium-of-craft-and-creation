      <p>Additionally at 3rd level, you gain the Telekinetics Discipline; this
      can be found under the Psionic Disciplines list of the psion class. You
      can use ki points as psi points, with a limit of 1 ki point. This limit
      increases to 2 ki points at level 5, 3 ki points at level 9, 4 ki points
      at level 13, and 5 ki points at level 17. The DC for your psionic
      abilities is equal to your ki save DC.</p>

      <p>If your character has both psi points and ki points, those are added
      together into one pool and can be used interchangeably. Your psi limit
      (and the limit you can use ki points as psi points) becomes your psi limit
      + one third of your monk levels rounded down.</p>

      <p>When you use your action on a psionic power or to cast a spell using
      this feature, you can make one attack with an unarmed strike or monk
      weapon as a bonus action before the end of your turn.</p>

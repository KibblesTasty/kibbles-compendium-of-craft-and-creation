      <p>Additionally at 3rd level, you gain access to an important arsenal of
      things that explode. Forgoing some subtlety for firepower, you gain the
      following options:</p><p><strong>Smoke Bomb.</strong> As an action, you
      can use this to cast
      @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.IBJmWjzbQGu7M4UX]{fog cloud} centered
      on yourself without expending a spell slot. It lasts a number of rounds
      equal to your Intelligence modifier and doesnâ€™t require concentration.
      When you cast fog cloud in this way, you can set the radius at 5, 10, 15,
      or 20 feet.</p><p><strong>Explosive Surprise.</strong> As an action you
      can toss explosives at a point within 30 feet. Creatures within 5 feet of
      the target point must make a Dexterity saving throw against your Gadget DC
      or take thunder damage equal to your Sneak Attack damage. If you are
      hidden from a creature, it makes the Dexterity saving throw with
      disadvantage. This counts as dealing Sneak Attack damage and reveals your
      location if you are hidden.</p><p><strong>Shaped Charge. </strong>As an
      action, you can place a charge on an object, building or surface within 5
      feet. At the start of your next turn, the charge detonates, dealing
      thunder damage equal to your Sneak Attack damage to the object, building
      or surface it was placed on, and half as much damage to any creature
      within 5 feet of it.</p>

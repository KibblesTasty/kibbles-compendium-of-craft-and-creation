      <p>Starting at 14th level, you can forge your Arcane Automation into new
      forms limited only by your creative vision. Select two of the following
      additional properties for it:</p>

      <ul>

      <li>It becomes Medium or Large (your choice).</li>

      <li>It gains a flying speed equal to its walking speed (if it doesn’t
      already have one).</li>

      <li>It gains additional temporary hit points at the end of a long rest or
      when summoned equal to Wizard level (giving it combined total hit points
      equal to twice your Wizard level).</li>

      <li>It can cast its cantrips as a 5th level caster, and regains half the
      uses of its cantrip casting when you use your Arcane Recovery
      feature.</li>

      <li>It can cast a spell from an Arcane Gadget without making an
      Intelligence (Arcana) check even if the spell requires concentration, as
      long as the spell is 2nd level or lower.</li>

      </ul>

      <p>You can select the same properties or new properties to replace them
      when you summon your familiar again with find familiar.</p>

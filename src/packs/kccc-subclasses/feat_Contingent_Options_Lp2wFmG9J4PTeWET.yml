      <p>At 7th level, you extend your innovation of the art of war to give
      yourself a unique advantage from your gear. For any option that has a
      spell save DC, your save is 8 + your Intelligence modifier + your
      proficiency bonus. Select one of the following options:</p>

      <ul>

      <li><strong>Charged Armor. </strong>As a bonus action, you can juice your
      armor with power with the effect of the lightning chargedK spell.</li>

      <li><strong>Rocket Boots.</strong> As a bonus action you can activate
      these to give yourself a jumping distance equal to your walking speed
      until the end of the turn. You take no fall damage from this movement, but
      creatures of your choice within 5 feet of where you land take 2d4 fire
      damage. Alternatively, you can use this to cast feather fall targeting
      only yourself.</li>

      <li><strong>Shifting Belt.</strong> You can use this to cast
      enlarge/reduce without expending a spell slot.</li>

      <li><strong>Flame Thrower.</strong> As an action or in place of one attack
      as part of the Attack action, you can use this to cast burning hands as a
      2nd-level spell without expending a spell slot.</li>

      <li><strong>Force Shield. </strong>You can deploy a temporary force field,
      with the effect of casting shield.</li>

      <li><strong>Thunder Grenade.</strong> As an action or in place of one
      attack as part of the Attack action, you can use this to cast shatter
      without expending a spell slot.</li>

      </ul>

      <p>You can use the selected item once, after which you must finish a short
      or long rest before you can use it again.</p>

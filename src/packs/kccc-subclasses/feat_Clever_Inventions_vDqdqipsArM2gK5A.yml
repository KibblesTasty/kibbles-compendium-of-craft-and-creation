      <p>Starting at 9th level, you expand your selection. Select two of the
      following options:</p>

      <p><strong>Gliding Cloak.</strong> You make a cloak that allows you to
      glide when falling. When you fall more than 10 feet and aren’t
      incapacitated, can spread this cloak to reduce your falling speed to 30
      feet a round and take no falling damage. While falling in this manner
      toward the ground under normal gravity, you can move horizontally 2 feet
      for every 1 foot you descend.</p>

      <p><strong>Mechanical Arm.</strong> You create a mechanical arm, giving
      you an extra hand. This mechanical arm only functions while it is mounted
      on gear you are wearing, but can be operated mentally without the need for
      your hands. This mechanical arm can serve any function a normal hand
      could, such as holding things, making attacks, and interacting with the
      environment, but it doesn’t grant you any additional actions.</p>

      <p><strong>Mechanical Familiar.</strong> You can create the blueprint for
      a small mechanical creature. At the end of a long rest, you can choose to
      create a mechanical familiar based on it, and cast find familiar spell
      without expending a spell slot. The familiar’s type is Construct. This
      construct stays active until you deactivate it or it is destroyed. In
      either case, you can choose to reactivate it at the end of a long
      rest.</p>

      <p><strong>Sight Lenses.</strong> You create a set of lenses you can
      integrate into a set of goggles, glasses, or other vision assistance that
      allow you to see through darkness and obscurement. You can see through
      fog, mist, smoke, clouds, and nonmagical darkness as normal sight up to 15
      feet.</p>

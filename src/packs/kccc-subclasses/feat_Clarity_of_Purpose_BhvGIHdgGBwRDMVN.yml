      <p>At 20th level, as an action, you can fully perceive the world around
      you for what it is, shattering the foul magics that bind and piercing the
      veils that hide, unrelenting and focused, gaining the following benefits
      for 1 minute:</p>

      <ul>

      <li>You can gain truesight with a range of 120 feet.</li>

      <li>You are immune to psychic damage.</li>

      <li>You have advantage on saving throws against magical or psionic
      effects.</li>

      <li>When you strike an enemy with a Divine Smite you can choose to cast
      dispel magic on the target as a bonus action without expending a spell
      slot. If the level of the spell slot spent on Divine Smite was higher than
      3rd level, you cast dispel magic at the level of spell slot spent.</li>

      </ul>

      <p>Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a
      long rest.</p>

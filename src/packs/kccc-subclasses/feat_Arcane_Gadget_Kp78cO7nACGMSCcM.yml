  description:
    value: "<p>Additionally at 2nd level, when you prepare spells for the day, you can turn them into arcane gadgets. Select spells with a casting time of 1 action, 1 bonus action, or 1 reaction. These spells do not count against your spells prepared, but you build them into tiny gadgets. You expend the spell slot as normal for casting the spell, and can choose if you expend any material component with a gold piece cost to incorporate it into the gadget (if the material component is not consumed, it can be reclaimed after the gadget is used). Subsequently a creature holding the gadget can use the gadget to cast the spell; they do not require verbal or somatic components, but do require material components if they are not included in the gadget. The gadget loses its power if you use it to cast the spell, if you finish a long rest, or if you regain the spell slot expended to create it (such as with Arcane Recovery).</p>\n<p>You can prepare a number spell slot levels this way equal to your Intelligence modifier (for example, if your Intelligence modifier is +3, you could prepare three 1st-level spells or one 3rd-level spell in this way).</p>\n<p>Creatures other than you can use your arcane gadgets. Creatures that do so are treated as if they cast the spell though it uses your spellcasting modifiers and proficiency bonus. If the spell requires concentration, they must pass an Intelligence (Arcana) check with a DC of 10 + the spellâ€™s level to cast the spell using the gadget. On a failure, the spell fizzles and is lost.\_</p>\n<p>Any spell cast by the gadget ends when the wizard recovers the spell slot spent to create the arcane gadget.</p>"

    value: >-
      <p>Starting at 6th level, your patron grants you another fragment of their
      vast power in the form of a gadget or tool. Your Invocations Known
      increases by 1, but one of your invocations must be from the options
      described in this feature.</p>

      <p><strong>Battle Drones </strong><em>(Prerequisite: Pact of the Chain
      feature, drone swarm familiar)</em></p>

      <p>Your Drone swarm can attack without you using your action to direct it
      attack. Its attack modifier becomes equal to your spell attack
      modifier.</p>

      <p><strong>Data Bank</strong></p>

      <p>While in possession of your contraption, you gain proficiency in two of
      Arcana, History, Medicine, or Nature which are selected when you gain this
      Invocation.</p>

      <p><strong>Dispatch Relay</strong></p>

      <p>You can use your Autocaster to cast sending once without expending a
      spell slot. Once you cast it this way, you can’t do so again until you
      finish a long rest.</p>

      <p><strong>Gliding Cloak</strong></p>

      <p>You make a cloak that allows you to glide when falling. When you fall
      more than 10 feet and aren’t incapacitated, you can spread this cloak to
      reduce your falling speed to 30 feet a round take no falling damage. While
      falling in this manner toward the ground under normal gravity, you can
      move horizontally 2 feet for every 1 foot you descend.</p>

      <p><strong>Mechanical Arm</strong></p>

      <p>You create a mechanical arm, giving you an extra hand. This mechanical
      arm only functions while it is mounted on gear you are wearing, but can be
      operated mentally without the need for your hands. This mechanical arm can
      serve any function a normal hand could, such as holding things, making
      attacks, interacting with the environment, etc, but doesn’t give you any
      additional actions.</p>

      <p><strong>Personal Shield</strong></p>

      <p>You gain the Armor of Shadows invocation. It doesn’t count against your
      Invocations known.</p>

      <p><strong>Neural Link</strong></p>

      <p>When you calculate a firing solution, it now applies to your current
      turn. Additionally, when you benefit from true strike, you negate the
      disadvantage of being unable to see a target (such as invisible or
      obscured target).</p>

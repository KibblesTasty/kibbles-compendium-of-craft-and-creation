      <p>Starting at 10th level, as a bonus action you can cause your
      Contraption to record your existence. Record your hit points, location,
      and any conditions you are affected by. At the start of your next turn,
      your current hit points, location, and conditions are returned to the
      saved state in a flash of light. If you die while having your save state,
      you can make a DC 15 Charisma saving throw (making the check as if you
      were alive) when the start of your next turn would have been. On success,
      you return as normal. On failure, you remain dead.</p>

      <p>Once you use this, you canâ€™t use this again until you finish a long
      rest.</p>

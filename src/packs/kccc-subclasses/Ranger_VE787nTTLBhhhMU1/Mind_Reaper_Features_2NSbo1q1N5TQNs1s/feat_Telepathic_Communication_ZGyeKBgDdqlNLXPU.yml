    value: >-
      <p>Additionally at 3rd level, you can communicate telepathically with any
      creature you can see within 30 feet of you. You donâ€™t need to share a
      language with the creature for it to understand your telepathic
      utterances, but the creature must be able to understand at least one
      language.</p>

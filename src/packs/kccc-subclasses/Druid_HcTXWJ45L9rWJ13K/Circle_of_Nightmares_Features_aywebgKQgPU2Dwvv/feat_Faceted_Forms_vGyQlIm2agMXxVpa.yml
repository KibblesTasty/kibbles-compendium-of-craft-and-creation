      <p>Starting at 10th level, you can gain both an Eye Stalk and a Grasping
      Tentacle when expending a use of Wild Shape on Eldritch Mutation. While
      you have both mutations manifested, you can use the effect of either of
      them as an action or bonus action.</p>

      <p>Additionally, you deal an additional die of damage with your Enervation
      Ray (2d8 + your Wisdom modifier), Disintegration Ray (2d10 + your Wisdom
      modifier), and Grasping Tentacle (2d6 + your Wisdom modifier).</p>

      <p>Starting at 2nd level, you apply your skills of magic and creation to
      forge a small mechanical helper. The
      @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.JGT5bNqu9REL7Fuz]{find familiar} spell
      is added to your spellbook. (If its there already add another 1st level
      Wizard spell of your choosing) Its material component becomes tinkerâ€™s
      tools (they are not consumed on casting), and when you summon it gains the
      traits for the creature selected, as well as the following additional
      traits:</p><ul><li>Its type becomes construct.</li><li>It acts on your
      turn.</li><li>It gains temporary hit points when summoned or at the end of
      a long rest equal to your Intelligence modifier + your wizard
      level.</li><li>As long as it is within 30 feet of you, you can cast spells
      as if you were in its position.</li><li>Select three wizard cantrips you
      can cast. Your familiar can cast these cantrips, casting them (in total) a
      number of times equal to your proficiency bonus (casting them as a 1st
      level caster). It uses your spellcasting ability modifier when casting
      these spells. It regains all uses when you finish a long rest.</li></ul>

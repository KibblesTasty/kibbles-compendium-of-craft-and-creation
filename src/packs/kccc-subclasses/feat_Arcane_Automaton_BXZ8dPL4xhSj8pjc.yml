      <p>Starting at 2nd level, you apply your skills of magic and creation to
      forge a small mechanical helper. The find familiar spell is added to your
      spellbook. (If its there already add another 1st level Wizard spell of
      your choosing) Its material component becomes tinkerâ€™s tools (they are not
      consumed on casting), and when you summon it gains the traits for the
      creature selected, as well as the following additional traits:</p>

      <ul>

      <li>Its type becomes construct.</li>

      <li>It acts on your turn.</li>

      <li>It gains temporary hit points when summoned or at the end of a long
      rest equal to your Intelligence modifier + your wizard level.</li>

      <li>As long as it is within 30 feet of you, you can cast spells as if you
      were in its position.</li>

      <li>Select three wizard cantrips you can cast. Your familiar can cast
      these cantrips, casting them (in total) a number of times equal to your
      proficiency bonus (casting them as a 1st level caster). It uses your
      spellcasting ability modifier when casting these spells. It regains all
      uses when you finish a long rest.</li>

      </ul>

  description:
    value: "<p>The Oath of Sanity is the oath of someone that has survived exposure to the horrors that lay beyond the veil, or perhaps someone that has prepared for them through a mystical order, a forgotten tradition... or particularly vivid and over active imagination.</p><p>While most who have glimpsed into the realms beyond suffer instant and irrevocable madness, these Paladins have glimpsed beyond and sworn to remain sane, no matter what the cost. They reject shielding their fragile mind from what they’ve seen in a comforting shroud of madness.</p><p>An Oath of Sanity Paladin will usually seem to others as true neutral or lawful neutral following obscure codes incomprehensible to those who haven’t experienced a brush with the beyond, their morality coming in blue and orange rather than black and white. Almost universally they are dedicated to preventing the threats from beyond from consuming the material world and shattering the fragile minds within.</p><h3><strong>Tenets of Sanity</strong></h3><ul><li><strong>Order.\_</strong>Never act on random or chaotic impulses. These are the cracks of madness.</li><li><strong>Vigilance.</strong>\_Never let your attention wander, lest you miss the signs of madness.</li><li><strong>Discipline.\_</strong>Never indulge in a lapse of behavior, your habits keep you safe from madness.</li><li><strong>Solemnity.</strong>\_Your work is terrible. Never take pleasure in it. That leads to the comfort of madness</li><li><strong>Sanity.</strong>\_No matter what, never give into madness.</li></ul><h3><strong>Oath of Sanity Quirks</strong></h3><p>The following are some optional quirks for a player of this Oath to choose from. These can be either preexisting, signaling their inevitable path toward this Oath, or appear over time due to the influence of their experiences. It is recommended that you have two quirks from this table... This Oath rarely results in individuals that would be considered normal.</p><p>@Embed[Compendium.kibbles-compendium-of-craft-and-creation.kccc-roll-tables.RollTable.CMICSe2wT23BqrDm]</p>"

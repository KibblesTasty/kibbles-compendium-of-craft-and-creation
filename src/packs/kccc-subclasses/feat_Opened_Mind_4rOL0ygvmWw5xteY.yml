      <p>Starting at 1st level, your mind has interacted with something that is
      incompatible to a mortal understanding, forcing it to be opened and
      adapted to new ideas and powers. You gain the ability to communicate
      telepathically with any creature you can see within 30 feet of you. You
      donâ€™t need to share a language with the creature for it to understand your
      telepathic utterances, but the creature must be able to understand at
      least one language. That creature can reply in kind.</p>

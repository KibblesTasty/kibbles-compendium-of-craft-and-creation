      <p>At 3rd level, you gain the ability to create special pieces of
      ammunition. You can have a number of these special shots equal to your
      proficiency bonus, recreating expended ones during a short or long
      rest.</p>

      <p>The DC for your Trick Shots is equal to your spell save DC.</p>

      <p>You can select from the following options for your special shots. You
      can make multiple copies of one shot, or select multiple different shots,
      as long as the total equals your proficiency bonus. You can swap out any
      unspent ones for other options during a short or long rest.</p>

      <ul>

      <li><strong>Binding Shot. </strong>Instead of doing damage, this shot
      turns into a net when striking the target. The net gains additional hit
      points equal to your Ranger level.</li>

      <li><strong>Flash Shot. </strong>When this shot hits a target, it emits a
      brilliant flash of light. The target and creatures within 15 feet of the
      target must make a Dexterity saving throw or become blinded until the
      start of your next turn.</li>

      <li><strong>Explosive Shot. </strong>When this shot hits a target, it
      emits an explosion. The target and creatures within 10 feet of the target
      must make a Dexterity saving throw or take 1d6 fire damage and 1d6 thunder
      damage.</li>

      <li><strong>Guided Shot. </strong>When fired, this shot tracks its target.
      This attack is made with advantage, and ignores cover, including complete
      cover, as long as there is a path to the target you are aware of that
      requires the shot to travel less than the maximum range of the weapon
      used.</li>

      <li><strong>Rocket Shot. </strong>The attackâ€™s range is doubled, and on a
      hit the target takes an extra 1d12 damage from the attack.</li>

      </ul>

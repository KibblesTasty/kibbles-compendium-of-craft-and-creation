      <p><strong>Turn the Aberrant.</strong> As an action, you can make any
      aberration or undead, provided that it’s within 30 feet and that can see
      or hear you, make a Wisdom saving throw. If the creature fails its saving
      throw, it is turned for 1 minute or until it takes damage. A turned
      creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it
      can, and it can’t willingly move to a space within 30 feet of you. It also
      can’t take reactions. For its action, it can use only the Dash action or
      try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If there’s
      nowhere to move, the creature can use the Dodge action.</p>

      <p>If the creature’s true form is concealed by an illusion, shapeshifting,
      or other effect, that form is revealed while it is turned.</p>

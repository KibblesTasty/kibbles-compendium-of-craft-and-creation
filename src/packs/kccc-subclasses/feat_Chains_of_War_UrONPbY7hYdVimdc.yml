      <p>Starting at 10th level, you can select one of the following, or one
      additional selection from Brutal Invention or Contingent Options.</p>

      <ul>

      <li><strong>Returning Chain.</strong> When you throw your Brutal Invention
      weapon at a target within 30 feet of you, you can return the weapon to
      your hand. If the weapon doesn’t have the thrown property, it gains the
      Thrown (10/30 property).</li>

      <li><strong>Grappling Hook.</strong> As an action, or in place of an
      attack as part of the Attack action, you may target a surface, object or
      creature within 20 feet. If the target is Small or smaller, you can make a
      Strength (Athletics) grappling check to pull it to you and grapple it.
      Alternatively, if the target is Medium or larger, you can choose to be
      pulled to it, however, this doesn’t grapple it. Opportunity attacks
      provoked by this movement are made with disadvantage.</li>

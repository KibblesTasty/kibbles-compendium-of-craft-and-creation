    value: >-
      <p>Additionally at 10th level, once per turn during your turn, when you
      are moving a creature you have grappled, you can smash them into various
      features of the battlefield. If the grappled creature’s movement is
      stopped by colliding with a Large or larger object, a Small or larger
      creature, or immobile terrain, the grappled creature and the object it
      collides with both take 1d6 bludgeoning damage for each 15 feet you had
      moved prior to the collision.</p>

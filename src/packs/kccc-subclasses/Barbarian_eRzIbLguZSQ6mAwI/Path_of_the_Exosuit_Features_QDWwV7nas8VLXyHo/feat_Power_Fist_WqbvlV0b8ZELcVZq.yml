      <p>Additionally at 6th level, when you make an attack roll with your Iron
      Fists, you can choose to forgo adding your proficiency bonus to the attack
      roll. If the attack hits, you can add double your Proficiency bonus to the
      damage roll. Additionally, your Iron Fists count as magical for the
      Purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and
      damage.</p>

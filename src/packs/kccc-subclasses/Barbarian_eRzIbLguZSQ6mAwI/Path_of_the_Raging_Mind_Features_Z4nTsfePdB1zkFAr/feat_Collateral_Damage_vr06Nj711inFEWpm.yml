    value: >-
      <p>Starting at 10th level, when you use Reckless Attack with a thrown
      weapon, you can ricochet to try and hit a second target within 5 feet of
      the first. Use the lower of the two dice you rolled for the Reckless
      Attack as the attack roll against the second creature. If disadvantage
      would cancel out the advantage from Reckless Attack, you may not use this
      feature.</p>

    value: >-
      <p>Starting at 14th level, you become the epicenter of the battlefield,
      flinging targets about. When you hit a target with a weapon while raging,
      you may choose to knock them 5 feet directly away from you on hit. When
      you use Telekinetic Force while raging, you can always choose to apply the
      Hurling modifier (as if using 2 psi points), shoving the target an
      additional 20 feet in a direction of your choice.</p>

      <p>Additionally, all Medium and smaller objects and creatures that you are
      holding become improvised weapons for you, dealing 1d6 bludgeoning damage,
      with the thrown 20/60 property. To throw an unwilling creature, you must
      have it grappled, and you canâ€™t throw it beyond its normal range.</p>

      <p>Whenever you shove or throw a creature into another creature, both
      creatures take [[/damage 1d6 bludgeoning]] damage.</p>

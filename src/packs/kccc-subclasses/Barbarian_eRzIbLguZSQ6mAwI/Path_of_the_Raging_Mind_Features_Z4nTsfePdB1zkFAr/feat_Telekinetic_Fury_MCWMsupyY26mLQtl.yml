    value: >-
      <p>Starting when you choose this path at 3rd level, when you enter a rage,
      you can telekinetically project your rage onto the world around you. All
      melee weapons gain a thrown 30/60 property for you. This range is reduced
      to 15/45 if the weapon has the heavy property and increased to 60/120 if
      the weapon has the light property.</p>

      <p>You can apply your Rage bonus damage to damage rolls made by thrown
      weapons, and can gain advantage from Reckless Attack on attacks made with
      thrown weapons.</p>

      <p>At the start of your turn while you are raging, you can call a number
      of weapons or Tiny objects equal to your proficiency bonus within 60 feet
      to you, as long as they are not being worn or carried. You call these to
      your hands or to telekinetically orbit around you until the end of your
      turn (after which they fall to the ground). Weapons telekinetically
      orbiting you can only be used when throwing that weapon. At the end of
      your turn (or if your rage ends) all orbiting weapons drop to the ground
      around you.</p>

  description:
    value: >-
      <p>Your patron is defined by its sheer incomprehensibility to the mortal
      mind, an existence that is the very anathema of sanity itself, where any
      attempt to truly describe its nature is the gibbering of a mad
      man.</p><p>The most tame examples of these may have names or euphemisms
      that mortals know them as, while others may be concepts that most mortal
      minds remain blissfully incapable of knowing the existence of.</p><p>The
      patron need not be aware of your existence or invested in it for their
      power to have affected you, fundamentally warping your mind and granting
      you powers. Most that would have this opportunity have their mind
      shattered, left tattered and insane by the experience, but youâ€™ve managed
      to hang onto some semblance of sanity and wield the power grafted into
      your mind.</p><hr /><p>The following are some optional quirks for a player
      who has formed a pact with That Which Is Beyond. You can optionally roll
      or select a quirk that suits your
      character.</p><p>@Embed[Compendium.kibbles-compendium-of-craft-and-creation.kccc-roll-tables.RollTable.ZCh8QK953rX6YY5c]</p>

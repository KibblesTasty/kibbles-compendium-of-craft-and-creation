      <p>At 18th level you can draw planes together causing them to smash
      together with devastating results. Select a plane to intersect the one you
      are on, you can’t select the plane you are currently on. As an action, you
      can spend 5 sorcery points to cause the planar intersection to occur at a
      point you can see within 120 feet, causing effects to occur based on the
      table below in a 30-foot-radius sphere around the chosen point. The effect
      lasts for a number of rounds equal to your Charisma modifier.</p><table
      border="1"><thead><tr><th
      style="width:70px"><p><strong>Plane</strong></p></th><th><p><strong>Effect</strong></p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><p>Shadow</p></td><td><p>The
      area is plunged into darkness and can’t be illuminated by natural or
      magical means.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Fey</p></td><td><p>Magic in the
      area goes haywire. A creature that casts a spell in the area or that
      targets a point within the area must succeed a Charisma saving throw when
      casting a spell, or a random spell from their spell list of that level or
      lower is cast (at the level of the spell they were trying to cast). Damage
      and healing dice are maximized for spells cast in the
      area.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Fire</p></td><td><p>The area is incinerated
      by fire. Creatures that end their turn within the area take [[/damage
      10d10 fire]] damage. This damage ignores
      resistance.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Ice</p></td><td><p>The area freezes
      over. Creatures that end their turn within the area must make a
      Constitution saving throw or take [[/damage 3d12 cold]] damage and become
      stunned frozen in ice until the end of their next
      turn.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Earth</p></td><td><p>The area becomes filled
      with stone and earth, shoving all creatures out of it outward from the
      center. If this would trap them into a wall they take [[/damage 3d12
      bludgeoning]] damage and are shoved to the closest free
      space.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Radiant</p></td><td><p>All creatures that
      end their turn in the area take [[/damage 6d6 radiant]] damage. All living
      creatures that end their turn in the area are healed for [[/healing 3d6]]
      hit points.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Beyond</p></td><td><p>All creatures
      that end their turn within the area must make a Wisdom saving throw or
      take [[/damage 3d12 psychic]] damage and be affected by the effects of the
      @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.9hQXdMSmerkTsHDe]{confusion}
      spell.</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p>Once you use this ability, you
      can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.</p>

      <p>At 18th level you can draw planes together causing them to smash
      together with devastating results. Select a plane to intersect the one you
      are on, you can’t select the plane you are currently on. As an action, you
      can spend 5 sorcery points to cause the planar intersection to occur at a
      point you can see within 120 feet, causing effects to occur based on the
      table below in a 30-foot-radius sphere around the chosen point. The effect
      lasts for a number of rounds equal to your Charisma modifier.</p>

      haywire. A creature that casts a spell in the area or that targets a point
      within the area must succeed a Charisma saving throw when casting a spell,
      or a random spell from their spell list of that level or lower is cast (at
      the level of the spell they were trying to cast). Damage and healing dice
      are maximized for spells cast in the area.</td>

      are shoved to the closest free space.</td>

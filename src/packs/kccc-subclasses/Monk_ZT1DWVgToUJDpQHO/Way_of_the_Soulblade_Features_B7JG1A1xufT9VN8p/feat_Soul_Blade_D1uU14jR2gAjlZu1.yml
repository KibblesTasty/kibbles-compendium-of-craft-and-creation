      <p>Starting when you choose this tradition at 3rd level, youâ€™ve learned to
      focus your ki into a psionic blade. As a bonus action, you can create a
      blade of pure scintillating psionic energy. The blade you create this way
      most typically takes the form of a knife-like blade projecting from your
      fist, but you can shape it however you choose. You can choose to create
      multiple blades, but any blade you are not touching vanishes at the end of
      your turn and must be resummoned.</p><p>Regardless of the form it takes,
      the weapon is a monk weapon for you, deals 1d8 psychic damage, and has the
      light, finesse, and thrown(20/60)
      properties.</p><p>@UUID[Compendium.kibbles-compendium-of-craft-and-creation.kccc-subclasses.Item.3zr3gNASxITpl2jQ]{Soul

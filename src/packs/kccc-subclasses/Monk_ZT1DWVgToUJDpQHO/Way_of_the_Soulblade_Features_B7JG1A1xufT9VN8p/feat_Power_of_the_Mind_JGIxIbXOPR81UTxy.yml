      <p>Starting at 11th level, your psionic abilities manifest more
      completely, giving you greater control and power in your psionic
      abilities.</p>

      <p><strong>Ethereal Sweep</strong></p>

      <p>When you use Extended Blade, you can sweep or stab through multiple
      creatures with a single blow. Once per turn, when you make an attack with
      your Soul Blade, if you have activated Extended Blade you can make a
      single additional weapon attack with your Soul Blade against a number of
      creatures equal to your Wisdom modifier within range.</p>

      <p><strong>Consumptive Blade</strong></p>

      <p>Whenever you kill a creature with your Soul Blade that has an
      Intelligence of 6 or higher, you can use your reaction to draw in part of
      their psionic essence. You regain 1d4 hit points and 1 expended ki
      point.</p>

      <p><strong>Empowered Discipline</strong></p>

      <p>When you use a Psionic Discipline, you can expend 1 ki point for free
      without exhausting the ki point on empowering the psionic power granted by
      the Discipline, even if you do not have any remaining ki (this canâ€™t be
      used on the spells granted by the Discipline).</p>

      <p>Starting at 6th level, your expertise with the blade allows you to
      control it in unique and powerful ways</p>

      <p><strong>Extended Blade</strong></p>

      <p>You can expend 1 ki point to give your Soul Blade the Reach property
      until the end of your turn.</p>

      <p><strong>Psionic Flurry</strong></p>

      <p>When you make a Flurry of Blows, you can make the additional attacks
      with your Soul Blade.</p>

      <p><strong>Soul Strike</strong></p>

      <p>When you take the Attack action, you use your soul blade to make a
      single piercing strike. Make a single attack using your action (forgoing
      any additional attacks gained from Extra Attack) to ignore all armor a
      creature has and treat its AC as 10 + its Dexterity. On a hit, the
      creature takes additional damage equal to your Wisdom modifier.</p>

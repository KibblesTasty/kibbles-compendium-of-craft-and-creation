      <p>At 14th level, you gain immunity to force damage. When you would take
      force damage, you regain health equal to half the damage you would have
      taken. You can gain a maximum amount of hit points this way equal to your
      sorcerer level, after which you no longer gain additional hit points until
      you finish a short or long rest.</p><p>Additionally, you learn the spell
      @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.15Fa6q1nH27XfbR8]{dispel magic}, or
      another sorcerer spell of your choice if you already know it. Dispel magic
      doesnâ€™t count against your spells known. When you successfully cast dispel
      magic or counterspell, you regain an expanded sorcery point (if you are
      not currently at your maximum) as you draw in the remnants of the broken
      magic.</p>

      <p>Starting at 14th level, you can cast Phase Rift as an action at will.
      In addition, when you use Phase Rift, you can expend a sorcery point to
      make it both Long and Disruptive, causing you to move an additional 10
      feet and deal an extra [[/damage 1d8]] damage to creatures that fail their
      save against it.</p>

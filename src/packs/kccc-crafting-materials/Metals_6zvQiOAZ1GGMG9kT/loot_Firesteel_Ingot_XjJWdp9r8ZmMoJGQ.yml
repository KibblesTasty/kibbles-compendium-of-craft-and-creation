      <p>The names for Icesteel, Darksteel, and Firesteel are intentionally
      generic to better map to unique metals that might be present in your
      setting, and may have other names. Adamatine and Mithril tend to be
      widespread (and consequently open source metals), but other more unique
      metals may vary based on setting.</p>

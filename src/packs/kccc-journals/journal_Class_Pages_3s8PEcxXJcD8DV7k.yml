          <p>A gnome sits hunched over a workbench in a room cluttered with
          every sort of tool, carefully drawing the final lines to an intricate
          rune. With a crackling hum of arcane energy, the completed rune flares
          with power, and she watches with a smile of pride as the golem comes
          to life and stands.</p><p>An ogre looms large over a dwarf, saliva
          sloping down its chin as it considers its hearty meal. Its growling
          anticipation turns into horrified roars of agony as the dwarf unloads
          terrifying blasts of thunderous power from a small, metal
          tube.</p><p>With a mighty bloom and a crackle of energy, a lone figure
          lands in the middle of the battlefield. As the smoke clears, a
          towering presence stands amidst the war-torn ruins clad in glowing,
          mechanical plate. The luminous visor swivels to inspect the wreckage.
          It raises a gauntlet, and lightning surges forth.</p><p>With a
          beckoning gesture, the elf summons a swirl of swords leaping from
          their sheaths and springing to life. The shocked bandits begin to edge
          away, breaking into a run as the swords exuberantly give
          chase.</p><p>Makers of magic-infused objects, inventors are defined by
          their innovative nature. Like wizards, they see magic as a complex
          system waiting to be decoded and controlled through a combination of
          thorough study and investigation. Inventors, though, focus on creating
          marvelous, new magical objects. Spells are often too ephemeral and
          temporary for their tastes. Instead, they seek to craft durable,
          useful items.</p><h4>Cunning Creators</h4><p>Every inventor is defined
          by a specific craft. Inventors see mastering the basics of a craft as
          the first step towards true progress, the invention of new methods,
          and innovative approaches. Inventors are arcane engineers, students of
          invention and warfare who craft deadly firearms, ingenious gadgets,
          magical armor, and mechanical beings that they can augment with
          magic.</p><p>All inventors are united by their curious and creative
          nature. To an inventor, magic is an evolving art with a leading edge
          of discovery and mastery that pushes further ahead with each passing
          year.</p><p>Inventors value novelty and innovation. This penchant
          pushes them to seek a life of adventure.</p><p>A hidden ruin might
          hold a forgotten magic item or a beautifully crafted mirror perfect
          for magical enhancement. Inventors win respect and renown among their
          kind by uncovering new lore or inventing new methods of
          creation.</p><h4>Boundless Imagination</h4><p>An inventor is not the
          sort to be limited by what already exists or by conventional wisdom.
          They combine all the tools at their disposal to go beyond—to discover
          new boundaries and promptly exceed them. Few things can stand in the
          path of an inventor with a mind to change the world.</p><p>Seeking to
          push beyond all and striving for the new is the unifying call of
          inventors, but how jealously they guard their secrets can vary
          greatly. Some push their knowledge upon the worlds, while others hoard
          it.</p><h4>Rivals and Challenges</h4><p>Inventors often acquire
          rivals—other inventors racing to be the first to unlock the secrets of
          the world, scrambling to be the one after whom a new magical theory or
          scientific breakthrough will forever be named. Theft and acquisition
          of stolen ideas can often become an issue when too many inventors
          clash over a field of expertise.</p><p>Further, inventors quickly make
          enemies of those who would just as soon see the world
          unchanged.</p><p>They are often viewed as dangerous upstarts or
          radical troublemakers with their newfangled ways of doing
          things.</p><p>These challenges rarely daunt an inventor for long and
          most often simply fuel their continued drive to rise above. Inventors
          are rarely set in their ways, and the hated rival of last week may be
          a research associate the next.</p><h4>Creating an Inventor</h4><p>When
          creating an inventor character, think about your character’s
          background and drive for adventure. Does the character have a rival?
          What drove your character down the path of becoming an inventor? Is it
          about curiosity and innovation, or is it about the power their
          inventions bring? Did your character learn from another inventor, or
          did they receive a vision or flash of inspiration to learn their
          craft?</p><p>Consider how your character interacts with the world and
          what they represent. Consult with your GM regarding guilds or
          societies your character might belong to.</p><h5>Quick
          Build</h5><p>You can make an inventor quickly by following these
          suggestions. For the Gadgetsmith, Thundersmith, Cursesmith, or
          Relicsmith specializations, make your highest ability score Dexterity,
          followed by Intelligence; for the Golemsmith, Infusionsmith,
          Potionsmith, or Runesmith specializations, make Intelligence your
          highest, followed by Constitution or Dexterity; and for Warsmith or
          Fleshsmith specializations, choose either Strength or Intelligence as
          your highest, with Constitution as your second-highest ability score.
          Second, choose a background that emphasizes your connection to a guild
          or society</p>

          <p>A huge orc flies across the room, smashing through tables and
          chairs before hitting the wall with a thunderous crash, collapsing
          dazed. A human, her eyes still glowing with unearthly power, tosses a
          few extra coins on the bar. “Sorry for the mess. If he wakes up, tell
          him to try picking on someone his own size next time.”</p><p>The
          prisoner’s expression turns from defiant to puzzled as the
          interrogator asks no questions, merely stares at them silently. His
          puzzled expression turns worried as he finds himself, unbidden,
          recalling where he stashed the loot. “Under the stables behind the
          Rusty Hook Inn” the interrogator finally speaks, as the thief’s
          expression becomes terrified.</p><p>“Ain’t you... cold or somethin’?”
          the dwarf asks the elf as they trudge through the snow, eying her
          simple robe and bare feet. “I just think ‘warm’” the elf replies with
          a distracted air. The dwarf snorts, a puff of chilled air. Typical elf
          nonsense. Except... they haven’t frozen to death yet. “Say... could
          you think some ‘warm’ this way?” the dwarf asks hopefully. To the
          dwarf’s surprise, the chill of the snow fades away completely. “That’s
          downright creepy... hey don’t stop now! Was jus’ sayin’ it was
          creepy.”</p><p>Psions are those who have tapped into a special
          otherworldly force, with the ability to actualize the power of their
          mind to accomplish impossible feats. Reading minds, lifting vast
          weights, and transcending physical limitations, they tend to inspire
          awe and terror in equal measure.</p><p>The exact nature of what
          psionic power is might be a question answered in your setting, or it
          might not be. Most view psionic power as coming from within, though
          other answers exist—anything from the leaking power of the realms
          beyond, to an alternate way to express magic, to an actualization of
          an individual’s will upon the world.</p><h4>Powerful
          Minds</h4><p>Since a psion’s weapon is their mind, they are always a
          careless thought away from harming those around them. For a psion, the
          line between thinking and doing can be very thin, forcing them to keep
          their thoughts and emotions in check, lest their powers run amok. This
          leads to many of them developing odd behaviors or mannerisms to help
          them control their state of mind, frequently seeming quite eccentric
          to an outside observer.</p><p>Consider how your psion keeps their
          powers in check, and how much their power bleeds into their everyday
          life. How reading minds may affect their body language or habits. Do
          they add wood to the campfire from the comfort of their bedroll, or do
          they restrain themselves from using their power for trivial matters
          lest they slip up?</p><h4>Misunderstood Power</h4><p>In a world of
          widespread magic, many will assume a psion to be a type of Sorcerer or
          Wizard, mistaking their powers for the common applications of magic.
          The common villager keeps only one mental category for the
          supernatural and creepy people that bend reality to their will. But
          even among magic users, a psion’s powers will frequently be found
          unnerving.</p><p>It is often those who do understand magic that find a
          psion’s abilities the most aberrant. A force that intersects the
          magical weave rather than obeys it, the nature of the power that the
          psion wields one can only contemplate with unease.</p><h4>Creating a
          Psion</h4><p>When creating a psion, consider your character’s
          background. How did you become a psion? Were you born with latent
          powers? Or did something happen to you granting your powers? Or did
          you intentionally train yourself through rigorous mental exercise to
          leverage them? Consider how developing a rare and mysterious power
          would have affected your interactions with people.</p><p>Consider what
          your purpose is with your newfound powers, or how you plan to use your
          powers. Do you intend to be taken for a Wizard casting magic, or are
          you freely open about being of a... different nature?</p><h5>Quick
          Build</h5><p>You can make a psion quickly by following these
          suggestions. First, make Intelligence your highest ability score,
          followed by Dexterity or Constitution. Second, choose a background
          that lends itself to intelligence skills.</p>

          <p>Druids are often thought of as the guardians of the natural order

          more often in stories told to frighten children or ancient legends

          use these powers to spread fear, savoring the terror of their victims.
          Others use their powers to dispense what they view as justifice,
          stalking down and reaping only those they believe have earned such a
          grim fate.</p>

          ranking mechanical overmind. They could even be an ancient lost rogue
          one, perhaps an Inventor of another era whose last act was to upload
          themselves in an incorporeal form, or perhaps it some-thing more
          alien, the ancient navigation system of an otherworldly ship that has
          gained sentience.</p><p>The possibilities are endless, but whatever
          its nature, it can grant you sufficiently advanced knowledge that for
          all intents and purposes is fabulous magical power.</p>

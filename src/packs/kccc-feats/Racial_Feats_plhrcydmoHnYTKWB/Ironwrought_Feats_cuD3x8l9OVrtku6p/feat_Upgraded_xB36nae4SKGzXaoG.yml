      <p>You can apply one unrestricted Golemsmith or Warsmith upgrade to
      yourself (as if you were the golem or the warplate). This can’t be an
      upgrade that increases your ability scores. Any ability the does the same
      thing as a feature from Modular Design doesn’t stack. (For example, you
      can’t take an upgrade that increases your AC by +1 if you already have
      Integrated Armor.)</p>

    value: >-
      <p>You specialize in developing poisons, granting you proficiency with
      poisoner’s kits and the following benefits:</p>

      <ul>

      <li>When you create a poison, you can specify a creature type that poison
      is specifically made for. That poison ignores resistance and immunity to
      poison damage for that creature.</li>

      <li>You can apply poison to a weapon or piece of ammunition as a bonus
      action, instead of an action.</li>

      <li>During a long rest, you can perform 1 hour of work using a poisoner’s
      kit to create a number of doses of potent poison equal to your proficiency
      bonus, which last until you apply them to a weapon or finish your next
      long rest. Once applied to a weapon or piece of ammunition, the poison
      retains its potency for 1 minute or until you hit with the weapon or
      ammunition. When a creature takes damage from the coated weapon or
      ammunition, that creature must succeed on a Constitution saving throw (DC
      equal to 8 + twice your proficiency bonus) or take 1d8 poison damage and
      become poisoned until the end of your next turn. On success, they take
      half as much damage and aren’t poisoned.</li>

      </ul>

      <p>When you use this feature to create poison, you can expend 15 gp per
      dose of poison to create a more deadly poison. When you do so, creatures
      that fail their Constitution saving throw against it take an extra 1d8
      poison damage.</p>

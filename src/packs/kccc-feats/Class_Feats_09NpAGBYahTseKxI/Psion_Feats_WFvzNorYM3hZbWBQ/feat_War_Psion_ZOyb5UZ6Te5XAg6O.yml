    value: >-
      <p>You have mastered utilizing psionics in the midst of combat, learning
      techniques that grant you the following benefits:</p><ul><li>You have
      advantage on Constitution saving throws that you make to maintain your
      concentration on a psionic ability when you take damage.</li><li>You can
      perform the somatic components of psionic abilities even when you have
      weapons or a shield in one or both hands.</li><li>When a hostile
      creatureâ€™s movement provokes an opportunity attack from you, you can use
      your reaction to use a psionic disciplines power or spell targeting the
      creature, rather than making an opportunity attack. The spell must have a
      casting time of 1 action and must target only that creature.</li></ul>

  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You develop a minor grasp of psionic power, either uncovering an innate
      potential within yourself, through contact with a psionic source, or
      through training. You gain one of the psionic disciplines of the Psion
      class, gaining the attached psionic feature and psionic power, but you do
      not gain use of any associated spells when you gain a Discipline from this
      feat. You gain 1 psi point that you can use to empower the Discipline. You
      regain use of this Psi Point when you finish a short or long rest.</p>

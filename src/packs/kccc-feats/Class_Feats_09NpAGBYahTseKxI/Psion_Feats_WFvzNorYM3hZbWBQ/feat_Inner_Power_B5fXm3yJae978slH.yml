      <p>Your body is powered by the inner powers that course through it. Your
      maximum psi or ki points (if you have both, your choice of which)
      increases by 1. At the end of your turn after expending one or more psi or
      ki points during your turn (not counting temporary or free points, such as
      those from Psionic Mastery), you heal for a number of hit points equal to
      the psi or ki points spent.</p>

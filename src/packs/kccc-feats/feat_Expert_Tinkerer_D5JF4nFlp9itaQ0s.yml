      <p>Your long experience with tinkering has granted you the following
      benefits:</p><ul><li>Your Intelligence ability score increases by 1, to a
      maximum of 20.</li><li>When you make a Tinkering crafting check, you can
      take 10 as the result of the d20 (instead of rolling) without spending
      additional time.</li><li>During a long rest, you can produce two pieces of
      Advanced Ammunition worth less than a total of 50 gp without material
      components beyond pieces of ammunition. This piece of ammunition is of
      temporary construction, and becomes a normal piece of ammunition after 24
      hours.</li></ul>

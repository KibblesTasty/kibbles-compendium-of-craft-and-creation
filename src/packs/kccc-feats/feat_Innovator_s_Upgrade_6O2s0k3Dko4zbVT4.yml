      <p>You’ve honed your mind into a nonstop analytical machine. You can
      select an additional upgrade from your subclass list. The upgrade must be
      from the Unrestricted list. This upgrade doesn’t count against your class
      upgrade total.</p>

      <p>If a feature allows you to exchange upgrades, you can exchange upgrades
      selected with this feat, but they must be selected from the same (or
      lower) level requirement category as the originally selected upgrade.</p>

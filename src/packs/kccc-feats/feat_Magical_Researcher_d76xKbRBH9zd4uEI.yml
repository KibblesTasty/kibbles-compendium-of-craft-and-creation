      <p>You delve the secrets of magic. You can make scrolls of spells you
      donâ€™t know, but each crafting check takes 8 hours (this can be completed
      incrementally). When you craft a scroll or make a magic item that
      reproduces a spell that deals damage, you can change the damage type of
      that spell it reproduces. Doing so raises the difficulty of crafting it by
      +2. Additionally, you can cast a spell from a scroll even if it is not on
      your spell list. If it is higher level than you can normally cast, you
      have advantage on the spell casting check to cast it.</p>

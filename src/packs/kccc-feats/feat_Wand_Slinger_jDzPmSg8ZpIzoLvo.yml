  description:
    value: >-
      <p>If you have a spell save DC higher than a wand you are attuned to, you
      can use your spell save DC instead.</p>

      <p>If you expend the last charge of a wand, you do not need to make a roll
      to see if it is destroyed.</p>

      <p>When you cast a spell with an item, you can make a single weapon attack
      with a weapon held in your other hand as a bonus action.</p>

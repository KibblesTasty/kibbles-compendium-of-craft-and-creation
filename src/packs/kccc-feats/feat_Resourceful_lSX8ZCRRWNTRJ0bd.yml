      <p>You’ve mastered every play that’ll give you an edge when it comes to
      using common items, and gain the following benefits:</p>

      <ul>

      <li>You are proficient with improvised weapons.</li>

      <li>You can add your proficiency bonus to the saving throw DC for common
      items used by you.</li>

      <li>When taking time to recover reusable items such as ball bearings or
      caltrops, no roll is required.</li>

      <li>Additionally, whenever you deal damage with alchemical acid,
      alchemical fire, caltrops, holy water, or oil, that damage increases by
      1d4 at 5th level, and again at 11th and 17th levels.</li>

      </ul>

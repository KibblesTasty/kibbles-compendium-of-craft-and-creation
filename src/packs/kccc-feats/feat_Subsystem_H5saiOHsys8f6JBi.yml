      <p>You gain the ability to divide your attention into a subroutine that
      can operate somewhat independently from your primary mind. You gain the
      following benefits from it:</p>

      <ul>

      <li>You can use this subsystem to maintain concentration on a cantrip.
      Effects that would cause you to make a Constitution saving throw to
      maintain your concentration apply to it, and it makes its save with a +0
      bonus. It can maintain concentration on only one cantrip at a time.</li>

      <li>If the subsystem is not concentrating on a spell, you can use it to
      make a Intelligence or Wisdom check (no action required) once per turn on
      your turn.</li>

      <li>Each time you fail at the same specific task during your turn (saving
      against the same spell effect, attacking the same target, searching for a
      specific hidden creature), if you attempt the exact same task on your next
      turn, you can roll an additional die, taking the higher die. All
      additional dice are reset when you succeed the task.</li>

      </ul>

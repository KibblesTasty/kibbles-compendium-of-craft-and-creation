      <p>You find the your material body isnâ€™t quite as set in stone as other
      mortals, being more of a whim of expression. You can minorly change your
      appearance (coloration, hair length, superficial features) or adapt
      yourself to new environments, gaining resistance to one type of damage of
      your choice from acid, cold, fire, lightning, or poison during a long
      rest. You lose any previous resistance from this feature when you adapt
      yourself to a new environment.</p>

      <p>Additionally, you can adapt your self to a greater extent, gaining the
      ability to cast alter self without expending a spell slot. Once you do so,
      you must expend a spell slot to cast it again until you finish a short or
      long rest.</p>

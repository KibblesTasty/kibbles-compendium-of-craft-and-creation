      <p>When you gain this feat, choose one of the following schools of magic:
      Abjuration, Divination, Conjuration, Enchantment, Evocation, Illusion,
      Necromancy, or Transmutation.</p><p>You learn a spell from the selected
      school. It must either come from the spell list of a class you have the
      spell casting feature of, or be a 1st- or 2nd-level spell. You can only
      select a spell of a level which you can cast. You can change your selected
      spell when you gain a level, selecting a new spell that fits the
      criteria.</p><p>Additionally, you can cast cantrips of the selected school
      as a bonus action. When you cast them as a bonus action, the cantrip is
      cast as if you were a 1st level caster. You can do this a number of times
      equal to your proficiency bonus, regaining all uses on a long rest.</p>

          itself on a success.</p>

          <p>For the duration, you can read the thoughts of certain creatures.
          When you cast the spell and as your action on each turn until the
          spell ends, you can focus your mind on any one creature that you can
          see within 30 feet of you. If the creature you choose has an
          Intelligence of 3 or lower or doesn't speak any language, the creature
          is unaffected.</p><p>You initially learn the surface thoughts of the
          creature—what is most on its mind in that moment. As an action, you
          can either shift your attention to another creature's thoughts or
          attempt to probe deeper into the same creature's mind. If you probe
          deeper, the target must make a Wisdom saving throw. If it fails, you
          gain insight into its reasoning (if any), its emotional state, and
          something that looms large in its mind (such as something it worries
          over, loves, or hates). If it succeeds, the spell ends. Either way,
          the target knows that you are probing into its mind, and unless you
          shift your attention to another creature's thoughts, the creature can
          use its action on its turn to make an Intelligence check contested by
          your Intelligence check; if it succeeds, the spell
          ends.</p><p>Questions verbally directed at the target creature
          naturally shape the course of its thoughts, so this spell is
          particularly effective as part of an interrogation.</p><p>You can also
          use this spell to detect the presence of thinking creatures you can't
          see. When you cast the spell or as your action during the duration,
          you can search for thoughts within 30 feet of you. The spell can
          penetrate barriers, but 2 feet of rock, 2 inches of any metal other
          than lead, or a thin sheet of lead blocks you. You can't detect a
          creature with an Intelligence of 3 or lower or one that doesn't speak
          any language.</p><p>Once you detect the presence of a creature in this
          way, you can read its thoughts for the rest of the duration as
          described above, even if you can't see it, but it must still be within
          range.</p>

          <p>You attempt to beguile a creature that you can see within range. It
          must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be charmed by you for the
          duration. If you or creatures that are friendly to you are fighting
          it, it has advantage on the saving throw.</p><p>While the creature is
          charmed, you have a telepathic link with it as long as the two of you
          are on the same plane of existence. You can use this telepathic link
          to issue commands to the creature while you are conscious (no action
          required), which it does its best to obey. You can specify a simple
          and general course of action, such as "Attack that creature," "Run
          over there," or "Fetch that object." If the creature completes the
          order and doesn't receive further direction from you, it defends and
          preserves itself to the best of its ability.</p><p>You can use your
          action to take total and precise control of the target. Until the end
          of your next turn, the creature takes only the actions you choose, and
          doesn't do anything that you don't allow it to do. During this time,
          you can also cause the creature to use a reaction, but this requires
          you to use your own reaction as well.</p><p>Each time the target takes
          damage, it makes a new Wisdom saving throw against the spell. If the
          saving throw succeeds, the spell ends.</p><p><strong>At Higher
          Levels.</strong> When you cast this spell with a 9th-level spell slot,
          the duration is concentration, up to 8 hours.</p>

          the Dash action and move away from you by the safest available route
          on each of its turns, unless there is nowhere to move. If the creature
          ends its turn in a location where it doesn't have line of sight to
          you, the creature can make a Wisdom saving throw. On a successful
          save, the spell ends for that creature.</p>

          course of action sound reasonable. Asking the creature to stab itself,

          creature within 60 feet of it to make a DC 14 Intelligence saving
